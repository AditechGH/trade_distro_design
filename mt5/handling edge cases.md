## ✅ **MT5 Edge Case Handling**
MT5 is at the core of the Trade Distribution System, and edge cases are expected due to the nature of real-time trade execution and broker connectivity. To ensure stability, consistency, and data integrity, we need to address all known and potential edge cases involving:

1. **Broker-Side Failures**  
2. **Connection and Network Failures**  
3. **Trade Execution Issues**  
4. **Account and Instance Failures**  
5. **Auto-Recovery Failures**  

We’ll define how to detect, handle, and recover from these scenarios while ensuring the system maintains consistent state across Redis, DuckDB, and ClickHouse.

---

## 🚨 **1. Broker-Side Failures**
Broker-side failures happen when the broker system is unresponsive, misconfigured, or temporarily unavailable.

### ✅ **1.1. Broker Downtime**  
- If MT5 fails to connect to the broker →  
  - Mark instance state as `FAILED` in Redis  
  - Attempt reconnect after **30 seconds** → Max retry = 5  
  - Trigger Prometheus alert  

**Recovery:**  
- If the broker comes back online → Restore state from Redis  
- If reconnection attempts exceed the limit → Mark state as `PERMANENTLY FAILED`  

### ✅ **1.2. Broker Rate Limits**  
- If broker returns error **10008** (too frequent requests):  
  - Back off for **1 minute**  
  - Apply **exponential backoff** for subsequent failures  
  - If rate limit persists → Stop instance after 3 failures  

**Recovery:**  
- If rate limit is lifted → Resume trading  
- If broker maintains limit → Notify and stop  

### ✅ **1.3. Broker-Side Maintenance**  
- If broker closes the market during maintenance →  
  - Stop instance and store the state in Redis  
  - Attempt recovery after **1 hour**  

---

## 🌐 **2. Connection and Network Failures**
Network and connection failures occur between MT5 and the broker, or between MT5 and the backend.

### ✅ **2.1. Network Drop During Trade Execution**  
- If MT5 connection drops during trade execution →  
  - Attempt reconnect within **5 seconds**  
  - If no reconnect → Mark trade as `PENDING` in Redis  
  - Backoff attempt = 3  

**Recovery:**  
- If connection is restored → Resume trade  
- If connection remains lost → Mark state as `FAILED`  

---

### ✅ **2.2. MT5 Terminal Crash**  
- If MT5 terminal crashes unexpectedly →  
  - Mark instance as `FAILED` in Redis  
  - Attempt to restart MT5 terminal within **30 seconds**  
  - If restart fails after 3 attempts → Stop instance  

**Recovery:**  
- If restart is successful → Resume trading  
- If restart fails → Notify and stop  

---

### ✅ **2.3. Redis Connection Failure**  
- If Redis connection is lost during state update →  
  - Store state update in DuckDB  
  - Attempt Redis reconnect after **10 seconds**  
  - On recovery → Sync state from DuckDB to Redis  

**Recovery:**  
- On recovery → Flush backlogged state to Redis  
- If recovery fails after 5 attempts → Stop instance  

---

## 📊 **3. Trade Execution Issues**
Trade execution issues arise from mismatched state, slippage, partial fills, and broker-side execution rejections.

### ✅ **3.1. Partial Fill**  
- If order partially fills →  
  - Adjust trade state in Redis  
  - Attempt to fill the remaining portion within **10 seconds**  
  - If unfilled → Cancel trade  

**Recovery:**  
- If fill is completed → Update trade state  
- If unfilled → Adjust position size and retry  

---

### ✅ **3.2. Slippage Beyond Threshold**  
- If slippage exceeds 3% of expected price →  
  - Cancel order  
  - Mark state as `FAILED`  
  - Notify backend  

**Recovery:**  
- If slippage returns to normal → Resume trading  
- If slippage persists → Increase backoff period  

---

### ✅ **3.3. Trade Execution Timeout**  
- If trade is not executed within **5 seconds** →  
  - Cancel order  
  - Mark as `FAILED`  
  - Attempt recovery after **10 seconds**  

**Recovery:**  
- If broker returns to normal → Resume  
- If timeout persists → Notify and stop  

---

### ✅ **3.4. Duplicate Order Handling**  
- If duplicate order is detected →  
  - Cancel the duplicate order  
  - Store it as `FAILED` in Redis  
  - Trigger alert  

**Recovery:**  
- Stop instance after 3 duplicate orders  
- Notify backend  

---

### ✅ **3.5. Stop Loss and Take Profit Misfire**  
- If SL/TP order misfires →  
  - Re-check state in Redis  
  - If position mismatch → Correct state  
  - If order state is unknown → Cancel and retry  

**Recovery:**  
- If misfire repeats → Stop instance  
- If order executes properly → Resume  

---

## 🏦 **4. Account and Instance Failures**
Issues involving broker accounts and instance configuration.

### ✅ **4.1. Account Disabled by Broker**  
- If broker disables the account →  
  - Stop instance immediately  
  - Remove state from Redis  
  - Clear credentials from PostgreSQL  

**Recovery:**  
- None → Account remains disabled  
- Notify user to update credentials  

---

### ✅ **4.2. Account Permissions Changed**  
- If broker changes permissions →  
  - Attempt reconnect after **1 minute**  
  - If permissions remain invalid → Stop instance  

**Recovery:**  
- None → User must manually update permissions  

---

### ✅ **4.3. Instance Corruption**  
- If instance state becomes corrupted in Redis →  
  - Rebuild state from DuckDB  
  - Attempt recovery within **5 seconds**  

**Recovery:**  
- If rebuild fails → Stop instance  

---

### ✅ **4.4. User-Initiated Instance Stop**  
- If user manually stops instance →  
  - Close open trades  
  - Save state to DuckDB  
  - Mark instance as `INACTIVE`  

**Recovery:**  
- None → User must manually restart  

---

## 🛠️ **5. Auto-Recovery Failures**
Auto-recovery failure scenarios occur when an instance is unable to recover within the allowed backoff period.

### ✅ **5.1. Recovery Failure**  
- If recovery attempts exceed **3 times** →  
  - Stop instance  
  - Notify user  

**Recovery:**  
- None → User must manually restart  

---

### ✅ **5.2. Race Condition in State Update**  
- If state update conflict is detected →  
  - Lock Redis key  
  - Retry update after **5 seconds**  
  - If conflict persists → Stop instance  

---

### ✅ **5.3. Reconnection Loop**  
- If MT5 reattempts connection continuously →  
  - Apply increasing backoff → Max retry = 5  
  - Stop after final retry

## 🔥 **6. Edge Cases in Redis State Handling**
| **State** | **Action** | **Recovery** |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| `PENDING` | Trade execution pending | Retry after 5 seconds |
| `FAILED` | Trade execution failed | Stop instance |
| `INACTIVE` | Account disabled | Stop instance |
| `CONNECTED` | Successfully logged in | Resume trading |
| `DISCONNECTED` | Network failure | Attempt reconnect |

---

## 🚨 **7. Prometheus Alerting for Edge Cases**
| **Edge Case** | **Trigger** | **Alert Action** |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Partial Fill** | Trade partially filled but incomplete | Notify + Attempt refill |
| **Slippage** | Slippage > 3% | Notify + Stop instance |
| **Duplicate Order** | Order duplication | Cancel order + Notify |
| **Login Failure** | 5 failed attempts | Notify + Stop instance |
| **Account Closed** | Account status = `DISABLED` | Stop instance + Clear state |
| **Connection Lost** | Network down > 30 seconds | Attempt reconnect + Notify |

✅ Define Redis key expiry strategy for edge cases  
✅ Finalize state consistency model for MT5 failure cases
