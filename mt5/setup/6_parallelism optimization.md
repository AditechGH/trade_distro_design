To efficiently run **100+ MT5 instances** per OS while keeping the footprint and overhead cost low, we need to focus on both **resource efficiency** and **parallelism optimization**. Here’s a detailed breakdown of optimizations across five critical areas:

---

## 🔎 **1. Reduce Memory Footprint and Disk Usage**  
### ✅ **1.1. Run MT5 in Headless Mode**
- MT5 has an option to run without a GUI using `-Silent` or `-AutoRun` mode:
```shell
terminal64.exe /portable /config:config.ini /auto_run
```
- This disables all graphical elements (charts, windows, etc.) and runs MT5 purely as a background task.  
- This alone can reduce memory usage by **30–40%**.

---

### ✅ **1.2. Strip Non-Essential Files from MT5 Directory**
After installing MT5:
- Remove the following unnecessary components:
  - **Chart templates**  
  - **Help files**  
  - **Language files**  
  - **Demo account files**  
  - **Indicators** (if not using them)  
  - **Unnecessary DLLs** (if not used by the EA)  
  - **Log files** (disable logging or redirect to /dev/null)  

**Example files to delete:**
- `MQL5\Indicators\*`
- `MQL5\Experts\Examples\*`
- `MQL5\Include\*`
- `logs\*`
- `history\*`
- `Profiles\*`

🔹 **Goal:** Keep MT5 directory under **50MB** per instance.  

---

### ✅ **1.3. Disable Charting and Historical Data**
- In the MT5 configuration file (`config.ini`):
```ini
[Common]
ChartDisplay=0
HistoryLoad=0
```
- No chart loading → Less CPU and memory load.  
- No historical data fetching → Lower disk I/O and bandwidth.  
- This reduces RAM usage by **30–50%** and CPU load by **60–70%**.  

---

### ✅ **1.4. Set Minimal History Depth and Chart Bar Limit**
- Reduce historical data depth to the absolute minimum:
```ini
[History]
MaxBars=100
```
- Removes the need for MT5 to store large amounts of historical data in memory.  

---

### ✅ **1.5. Disable Market Scanning and Market Watch**
- Disable fetching live quotes for symbols you’re not trading:
```ini
[MarketWatch]
Symbols=EURUSD,GBPUSD,USDJPY
```
- MT5 will no longer monitor thousands of symbols, reducing bandwidth and CPU load.  

---

## 🔎 **2. Reduce CPU and Threading Load**
### ✅ **2.1. Lower CPU Affinity and Thread Count**
- Limit MT5 to fewer CPU cores to prevent CPU overload:
```shell
taskset -c 0,1 ./terminal64.exe
```
- Run MT5 using fewer threads:
```ini
[Common]
MaxThreads=2
```
- This prevents thread contention and keeps CPU utilization low.  
- Ideal for running multiple instances on multi-core CPUs.  

---

### ✅ **2.2. Throttle Tick Processing Rate**
- MT5 processes ticks at high speed — introduce throttling:
```ini
[Trade]
MaxTicksPerSecond=10
```
- Reduces CPU spike handling and keeps load manageable.  

---

### ✅ **2.3. Use NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) Binding**  
- Bind MT5 instances to specific CPU cores and NUMA nodes:
```shell
numactl --physcpubind=0,1 --membind=0 ./terminal64.exe
```
- Improves memory locality and reduces latency for multi-core CPUs.  

---

## 🔎 **3. Optimize Memory Usage**
### ✅ **3.1. Lower Memory Limits**
- Limit the total memory MT5 can use:
```ini
[Memory]
MaxMemory=128
```
- Forces MT5 to drop old tick data instead of growing indefinitely.  

---

### ✅ **3.2. Enable Memory Compression (Windows-Specific)**
- Windows supports memory compression:
```shell
Enable-MMAgent -MemoryCompression
```
- Reduces memory consumption by up to **30%** when many instances are running simultaneously.  

---

### ✅ **3.3. Use Shared Memory for Tick Data**  
- Instead of keeping tick data per instance, share it between instances:
- Rust engine can store shared tick data in Redis → MT5 instances read directly from Redis.  
- Reduces memory duplication across instances.  

---

## 🔎 **4. Reduce Network Load**
### ✅ **4.1. Remove Quote Streaming for Symbols Not in Use**
- Disable unused pairs in `config.ini`:
```ini
[MarketWatch]
Symbols=EURUSD,GBPUSD
```

---

### ✅ **4.2. Switch to UDP for Tick Data**
- MT5 can read UDP data streams:
- Lower bandwidth consumption than TCP.
- Reduces TCP connection load → Lower network contention.  

---

### ✅ **4.3. Offload Data to Redis (Tick Data, Trade State)**
- Redis will store trade state and tick data → Instances will read from Redis rather than MT5 streaming it directly.  
- Reduces direct MT5-to-broker bandwidth consumption.  
- Sync Redis with MT5 every **500ms** instead of every tick.  

---

## 🔎 **5. Optimize Instance Management**
### ✅ **5.1. Set Limits on Running Instances Per CPU Core**
- MT5 is CPU-bound → Limit instances per core:
- Rule of thumb:
   - **1 Core = 3 Instances** (If charting is disabled)  
   - **1 Core = 2 Instances** (If charting is enabled)  

---

### ✅ **5.2. Implement Pooled Instance Strategy**  
- Instead of starting new MT5 instances every time:
   - Create a pool of pre-initialized MT5 instances.  
   - Bind them to brokers at runtime based on demand.  
   - Example:  
     - Create 10 MT5 instances per broker.  
     - When a new trade signal arrives → Bind to an available instance.  
   - When the trade is over → Instance is returned to the pool.  

---

### ✅ **5.3. Create Rust-Based Orchestration Layer**  
- Use Rust to handle:
   - Tick data distribution (Redis)  
   - Trade signal delivery  
   - Trade execution status monitoring  
   - Instance state tracking  

---

## 🔥 **Goal State After Optimization**  
| Metric | Goal |
|--------|------|
| **MT5 Binary Size** | < 50MB per instance |
| **Memory Usage** | < 250MB per instance |
| **CPU Usage** | < 5% per instance |
| **Deployment Time** | < 1 second |
| **Tick Data Latency** | < 50ms |
| **Concurrent Instances** | 100+ per OS |
| **Network Usage** | < 2 Mbps per instance |

---

## 🚀 **Proposed Strategy**
1. Create a stripped-down and compressed MT5 build.  
2. Store the compressed build in a single directory.  
3. Extract the instance files on demand.  
4. Configure each instance using broker-specific JSON files.  
5. Control and monitor instances using a lightweight Rust-based engine.  
6. Offload state, trade data, and tick data to Redis for scalability.  
7. Sync data to ClickHouse using a Python-based backend.  
8. Throttle network and CPU load to prevent overload.  

---

## ✅ **Expected Outcome After Optimization**
✔️ CPU load per instance → **<5%**  
✔️ Memory usage per instance → **<250MB**  
✔️ Deployment time → **<1 second**  
✔️ Network usage per instance → **<2 Mbps**  
✔️ Expected load at 100 instances → **Max CPU load ~30–40%**  
✔️ Parallel order execution with minimal latency
