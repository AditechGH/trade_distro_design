MT5 itself **cannot run in a compressed mode** directly — it requires the files to be fully extracted and accessible for execution. However, you can take the following approach to reduce the memory and disk footprint:

---

## ✅ **Approach 1: Compress the Bootstrapped Version and Uncompress Per Instance**  
This is the most practical and widely used approach:

1. **Create a lightweight version** of MT5 by:
   - Removing unnecessary files (indicators, charting, help files, etc.).
   - Stripping graphical and UI components (if not needed).  
   - Removing unused DLLs and language files.  

2. Create a **compressed version** of this minimal MT5 setup:
   - Use `.zip` or `.tar.gz` to compress the files.  
   - This will significantly reduce the storage footprint (by 40–70% depending on the broker files).  

3. During instance creation:
   - Copy the compressed file to the instance location.  
   - Uncompress it programmatically (via Rust or Python) when creating the instance.  
   - This reduces the disk footprint and speeds up deployment.  

4. **Launch the uncompressed instance** once extracted:
   - Each instance will have its own folder.
   - Use configuration files (like `config.ini`) to store instance-specific parameters.

5. After the instance is closed:
   - Optionally delete the extracted files (if disk space is a concern).  
   - Keep the compressed version to allow for quick redeployment.

### ✅ **Advantages:**
✔️ **Fast Deployment** → Copying a single compressed file is faster than deploying raw files.  
✔️ **Minimal Disk Footprint** → Only keep extracted versions for running instances.  
✔️ **Easy Maintenance** → Updating the base version involves replacing a single compressed file.  
✔️ **No Overhead** → MT5 itself still runs at native speed.  
✔️ **Version Control** → Easier to update versions by just updating the compressed file.

### ✅ **Example Workflow:**
1. Bootstrap a lightweight version of MT5 → `MT5_Lightweight.zip`  
2. Store `MT5_Lightweight.zip` in the app's resource folder.  
3. When creating a new instance:
   - Unzip to `AppData\MT5\Instance_{ID}`  
   - Create broker-specific `config.ini`  
4. Start the instance  
5. On shutdown:
   - Delete instance files (optional)  
   - Keep only the compressed version

## ✅ **Approach 2: Memory-Mapped Running (Less Effective)**
While MT5 can't directly run compressed files, you **could try memory-mapping** the files instead:

1. Load the compressed version into memory using a memory-mapped file.  
2. Extract and load the executable and key files into memory at runtime.  
3. Keep the file in memory while the instance is running.  
4. Flush it on exit.  

### ❌ **Problems with This Approach:**
- MT5 requires direct access to configuration files → memory-mapping will likely fail.  
- File locking and memory-access errors are likely to appear.  
- Higher memory consumption since the compressed file is kept in memory.  
- Could trigger antivirus warnings due to executable loading from memory.  

---

## ✅ **Best Strategy**
- Use **Approach 1** — compressed version per instance.  
- Maintain a single compressed version for all instances.  
- Create a management script to handle:  
   - Extraction  
   - Config writing  
   - Instance launching  
   - Cleanup on exit  
- For even more optimization → disable charting, UI, and historical data requests.

### 🚀 **Recommendation:**  
👉 Compress a lightweight MT5 build into a `.zip` file.  
👉 Extract it per instance only when creating an instance.  
👉 Delete extracted files after session end (if memory pressure is an issue).  
👉 ✅ This keeps the disk usage low, speeds up deployment, and minimizes resource consumption.
