Yes â€” **MT5 returns specific error codes** after an unsuccessful login attempt or connection failure. These error codes are provided via the MQL5 API (specifically from the `GetLastError()` function) and can help us handle login failures more effectively.

## âœ… **Common MT5 Error Codes for Login and Connection Failures**
Below are the most common MT5 error codes that we will likely encounter during login attempts and connection handling:

| **Error Code** | **Description** | **Cause** | **Suggested Handling** |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **10004** | Invalid account | Wrong login or password | Stop instance after max retries |
| **10006** | No connection to trade server | Server down or wrong server IP | Retry with backoff |
| **10007** | Not enough rights | Permissions issue on broker side | Stop instance + Notify |
| **10008** | Too frequent requests | Broker has imposed a request limit | Backoff and retry |
| **10009** | Malformed data | Wrong data format during login | Stop instance + Notify |
| **10010** | Invalid request | Invalid login request | Stop instance + Notify |
| **10011** | Terminal not connected | No internet connection or firewall block | Retry with backoff |
| **10012** | Account disabled | Account banned or closed by broker | Stop instance + Notify |
| **10013** | Trade timeout | Server timeout during login | Retry with backoff |
| **10014** | Invalid authorization | Incorrect login token or expired token | Stop instance + Notify |
| **10015** | Password changed | Broker password was changed | Stop instance + Notify |
| **10016** | Old version of terminal | MT5 client is outdated | Stop instance + Notify |
| **10017** | No trading permission | Account permission issue | Stop instance + Notify |
| **10018** | Disconnected | Network loss during login | Retry with backoff |
| **10019** | Market closed | Broker market closed during login | Stop instance + Notify |
| **10020** | Too many logins | Broker rate-limiting logins | Backoff and retry |
| **10021** | Invalid broker server address | Incorrect server IP or DNS issue | Stop instance + Notify |
| **10022** | Connection closed | Broker closed connection during login | Backoff and retry |
| **10023** | Session expired | Login session expired | Retry with new session token |

## âœ… **How to Handle These Errors**
### ðŸš€ **1. Error Classification**
1. **Client-Side Errors** â†’ Errors caused by misconfiguration or network issues (e.g., invalid credentials, expired token).  
2. **Broker-Side Errors** â†’ Errors caused by broker restrictions (e.g., too many requests, market closed).  
3. **Infrastructure Errors** â†’ Errors caused by connectivity issues (e.g., network loss).  

---

### ðŸš€ **2. Backoff Strategy**
1. **Client-Side Errors** â†’ Stop instance after 5 failed attempts.  
2. **Broker-Side Errors** â†’ Apply exponential backoff + attempt reconnection.  
3. **Infrastructure Errors** â†’ Attempt auto-recovery after 10 seconds.  

---

### ðŸš€ **3. Error Mapping to Redis State**
We will store the **last error state** and track login attempts in Redis for better handling:

| **Redis Key** | **Example Value** | **Purpose** |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `instance_state:<instance_id>:last_error_code` | `10004` | Tracks the last login failure code |
| `instance_state:<instance_id>:login_failure_reason` | `Invalid account` | Tracks the last login failure reason |
| `instance_state:<instance_id>:login_attempt_count` | `3` | Tracks the number of failed login attempts |
| `instance_state:<instance_id>:status` | `FAILED` | Marks instance state after repeated failures |

---

### ðŸš€ **4. Prometheus Alerting for Error Codes**
We can create Prometheus alerts based on MT5 error codes:

| **Alert Type** | **Trigger** | **Action** |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| **Authentication Failure** | Error Code `10004`, `10014` | Stop instance + Notify |
| **Connection Error** | Error Code `10011`, `10018`, `10022` | Attempt reconnect + Notify |
| **Permission Error** | Error Code `10007`, `10017` | Stop instance + Notify |
| **Rate Limiting** | Error Code `10008`, `10020` | Backoff + Retry |
| **Account Disabled** | Error Code `10012` | Stop instance + Notify |
| **Market Closed** | Error Code `10019` | Stop instance + Notify |
| **Session Expired** | Error Code `10023` | Retry with new session token |

---

### ðŸš¨ **5. Edge Cases**
âœ… **Edge Case 1:** If MT5 returns `10016` (Old version of terminal):  
- Notify the user to update the terminal.  
- Stop the instance and prevent reconnection until the update is complete.  

âœ… **Edge Case 2:** If MT5 returns `10012` (Account disabled):  
- Stop the instance permanently.  
- Remove account state from Redis and DuckDB.  
- Notify the user.  

âœ… **Edge Case 3:** If MT5 returns `10020` (Too many logins):  
- Apply exponential backoff with increasing intervals.  
- Stop after 5 failed attempts.  

âœ… **Edge Case 4:** If MT5 returns `10011` (No internet connection):  
- Attempt reconnection every **30 seconds**.  
- Stop after 5 consecutive failures.  

---

## âœ… **Example Handling in Rust (Pseudo Code)**
```rust
if let Err(err) = mt5_login(&broker, &account) {
    match err {
        10004 => stop_instance("Invalid account"), // Stop immediately
        10008 => backoff_and_retry(30),            // Broker-imposed limit â†’ Retry after backoff
        10012 => stop_instance("Account disabled"), // Stop permanently
        10020 => backoff_and_retry(60),            // Too many requests â†’ Backoff
        10016 => notify_user("Update MT5 terminal"), // Notify user to update
        _ => retry_after_delay(10),                // General connection errors â†’ Retry
    }
}
```

## âœ… **Summary of Error Code Handling Strategy**
| **Error Type** | **Example Codes** | **Strategy** |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------|
| **Authentication Errors** | `10004`, `10014` | Stop after 5 failed attempts |
| **Connection Errors** | `10011`, `10018`, `10022` | Retry after increasing backoff |
| **Broker Restrictions** | `10008`, `10020` | Backoff and retry |
| **Infrastructure Errors** | `10023` | Retry with new session token |
| **Permission Errors** | `10007`, `10017` | Stop and notify |
| **Account State Errors** | `10012` | Stop permanently + Notify |
| **Market State Errors** | `10019` | Stop and notify |
