# ✅ **MT5 Performance Tuning**  
*(Architectural Design for MT5 Performance Optimization)*  

---

## **1. Overview**  
Performance tuning for MT5 integration focuses on improving the efficiency and responsiveness of the trade execution pipeline, reducing latency, and optimizing resource utilization. The key focus areas include:  
- Efficient trade execution  
- Minimal latency for trade signals  
- High throughput for state updates and data flow  
- Reduced CPU and memory overhead  
- Handling of large volumes of simultaneous trade requests  
- Efficient use of network bandwidth  

---

## **2. Key Performance Metrics**  
The following performance metrics will be tracked and tuned:  

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Signal Processing Latency** | Time taken to process a trade signal from receipt to execution. | ≤ 10ms |
| **Trade Execution Latency** | Time taken to execute a trade with the broker after submission. | ≤ 50ms |
| **State Update Latency** | Time taken to update state in Redis after trade execution. | ≤ 5ms |
| **Max Throughput** | Maximum number of trade signals processed per second. | ≥ 100 trades/sec |
| **Concurrency** | Number of trade signals processed concurrently. | ≥ 100 trades |
| **Memory Usage** | Amount of memory used by MT5 and Redis for trade state retention. | ≤ 500MB |
| **CPU Load** | Percentage of CPU load when processing trade requests. | ≤ 60% |
| **Network Latency** | Time taken to send data between components over the network. | ≤ 5ms |

## **3. Trade Signal Flow Optimization**  
### ✅ **3.1. Event-Based Execution**  
- **Trade signal processing will be event-driven** to minimize latency.  
- Rust will capture the trade signal and push it to Redis-RTSS (Trade Signal Stream).  
- Redis streams will allow concurrent processing of multiple signals → Minimize processing time.  
- Each signal will be processed using a lightweight thread (Rust) to avoid bottlenecks.  

**Why Event-Based Execution?**  
✅ Allows real-time processing of trade signals.  
✅ Supports concurrent trade execution.  
✅ Reduces latency by minimizing polling.  

---

### ✅ **3.2. Parallel Processing**  
- Rust will handle parallel execution of trade signals using:  
   - **Async I/O** → To handle multiple signals without blocking.  
   - **Thread Pooling** → Rust will maintain a pool of threads to execute trade signals concurrently.  

**Concurrency Model:**  
- Trade execution → Managed using Rust threads.  
- State updates → Managed using Redis pipelining.  
- Data sync → Managed using backend Python thread pool.  

**Concurrency Goal:**  
- Process up to **100 trades concurrently**.  

---

### ✅ **3.3. Trade Batching**  
- Trade signals will be processed in batches to reduce network overhead and improve throughput.  
- Batches will be triggered based on:  
   - **Signal Count** → Every 50 signals  
   - **Time Interval** → Every 500ms  
- Redis `XADD` commands will be pipelined for batch insertion.  

**Batch Size Target:**  
- 50 signals per batch or every 500ms  
- Max network packet size = **64KB**  

---

### ✅ **3.4. Optimized Trade Result Handling**  
- Trade results will be processed asynchronously using Redis streams (RTSS).  
- Trade execution status will be cached in Redis-RTS (Trade State).  
- Final trade result will be written to DuckDB for long-term storage.  

**Trade Result Write Strategy:**  
- Primary → Write to Redis (RTS) for state retention  
- Secondary → Write to DuckDB for storage  
- Sync → Sync from DuckDB to ClickHouse (backend Python)  

---

## **4. State Update Optimization**  
### ✅ **4.1. Redis Pipelining for State Updates**  
- State updates to Redis will be done using pipelining → This reduces network round trips.  
- Pipelining will be used for:  
   - Trade state updates  
   - Account balance updates  
   - Position status updates  
   - Equity updates  

**Target State Update Time:**  
- ≤ 5ms  

---

### ✅ **4.2. Reduced Memory Footprint for Open Trades**  
- Open trades will be retained in Redis for real-time processing.  
- Closed trades → Expire after **30 days** (handled using Redis expiry).  
- Trade state will be compressed using **LZ4** compression to reduce memory usage.  

---

### ✅ **4.3. Connection Pooling for Redis**  
- Connection pooling will reduce connection overhead.  
- Rust will use a pool of Redis connections to handle state updates and trade signals.  

**Target:**  
- **Max 100 connections** in the pool.  
- **Idle timeout** → 60 seconds.  

---

## **5. Trade Execution Optimization**  
### ✅ **5.1. Trade Signal Prioritization**  
- Trade signals will be prioritized based on:  
   - Signal Type → Market orders processed first.  
   - Order Size → Large orders processed first.  
   - Account Type → Higher priority to professional accounts.  

---

### ✅ **5.2. Broker-Specific Rate Limits**  
- MT5 server imposes rate limits on trade execution:  
   - Max **10 requests per second** for market orders.  
   - Max **5 requests per second** for limit orders.  
- Execution engine will track rate limits and throttle signals accordingly.  

---

### ✅ **5.3. Intelligent Order Routing**  
- Orders will be routed based on:  
   - Broker latency  
   - Account balance  
   - Trading conditions  
   - Broker-specific execution speed  
- If a broker connection is lost → Fallback to secondary broker if available.  

---

## **6. Resource Optimization**  
### ✅ **6.1. CPU Usage Control**  
- Rust trade engine will limit CPU usage using:  
   - Thread pool size → Max **20 threads**  
   - Async I/O → Non-blocking processing  
   - Yielding for low-priority signals  

---

### ✅ **6.2. Memory Usage Control**  
- Redis will be configured with a memory limit:  
   - `maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru` for RTSS and RTRS  
   - `volatile-lru` for trade state cache  
   - Trade state cache → Max 500MB  
   - Signal stream → Max 100MB  

---

### ✅ **6.3. Network Usage Control**  
- Redis to MT5 connection → Max throughput **100 Mbps**  
- Trade signal batch size → Max 64KB  
- Trade state update batch size → Max 32KB  

---

## **7. Error Handling and Failover**  
### ✅ **7.1. Auto-Recovery from Connection Loss**  
- If Redis connection fails → Attempt reconnect after **5 seconds**.  
- If MT5 server connection fails → Attempt reconnect after **3 seconds**.  

---

### ✅ **7.2. Fallback Broker Handling**  
- If broker rejects order → Attempt execution on fallback broker.  
- If fallback broker rejects order → Notify user.  

---

### ✅ **7.3. Handling Trade Signal Overload**  
- If Redis signal queue exceeds threshold →  
   - Drop low-priority signals.  
   - Throttle processing rate.  

---

## **8. MT5 Trade Engine Load Testing**  
### ✅ **8.1. Load Test Cases:**  
| Test Case | Description | Goal |  
|-----------|-------------|-------|  
| **High Frequency Trading** | Process 100 signals/sec | Latency ≤ 10ms |  
| **Large Order Processing** | Process order size > 10 lots | No delay in processing |  
| **Burst Load** | Process 500 signals in 1 second | No packet loss |  
| **Broker Failover** | Fail primary broker connection → fallback | Reconnect in ≤ 3 seconds |
