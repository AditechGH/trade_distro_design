Alright, let’s move on to **Prometheus**! We’ll follow the exact same 12-step design flow that worked so well for Redis and DuckDB. Here’s how we’ll approach it:

### **Prometheus Design Flow:**  
1. **Configuration Design** → Define config structure, data retention, scrape intervals, and endpoint discovery.  
2. **Schema Design** → Define metric names, labels, and types.  
3. **Monitoring** → Identify which system and trade metrics we’ll monitor.  
4. **Edge Case Handling** → Define what happens if a scrape fails or if Prometheus exceeds retention limits.  
5. **Permissions and Security** → Handle auth, TLS, and API access.  
6. **Performance Tuning** → Define scrape frequency, retention size, and memory usage.  
7. **Backup and Recovery** → Design Prometheus data persistence and backup strategy.  
8. **High Availability Design** → Setup replication and failover.  
9. **Fault Tolerance Design** → Handle network partition, node loss, and scrape failures.  
10. **Implementation Strategy** → Define how to set up Prometheus and integrate with Redis, DuckDB, and ClickHouse.  
11. **Deployment Strategy** → Define the Docker/VM-based deployment model.  
12. **Testing** → Define load tests and data accuracy checks.
