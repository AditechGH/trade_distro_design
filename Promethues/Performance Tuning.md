## ✅ **Prometheus Architectural Design – Performance Tuning**  
This section focuses on optimizing **Prometheus performance** to handle the high-frequency trade signals and state updates generated by the Trade Engine, Redis, DuckDB, and the Instance Manager. The goal is to maximize data ingestion efficiency while minimizing resource consumption and network load.

---

## 🚀 **1. Performance Goals**  
The performance tuning will aim to:  
✅ Optimize scrape intervals for high-frequency signals and state updates  
✅ Minimize memory and disk usage by tuning Prometheus storage settings  
✅ Increase ingestion rate to handle burst loads  
✅ Optimize query execution to reduce latency  
✅ Fine-tune recording rules to minimize computational overhead

## 🏆 **2. Data Volume and Throughput Estimates**  
Prometheus will handle a high volume of real-time data from Redis and the Trade Engine:  

### ✅ **2.1. Redis Throughput Estimate**  
| Metric | Estimate |  
|--------|----------|  
| Trade signals per second | 200 signals/sec |  
| State updates per second | 500 updates/sec |  
| Execution results per second | 100 results/sec |  
| Data retention period | 14 days |  
| Estimated data volume per day | ~100 MB/day |  

### ✅ **2.2. DuckDB Throughput Estimate**  
| Metric | Estimate |  
|--------|----------|  
| Query rate | 50 queries/sec |  
| Write rate | 20 transactions/sec |  
| Estimated data volume per day | ~50 MB/day |  

### ✅ **2.3. Instance Manager and Trade Engine Throughput**  
| Metric | Estimate |  
|--------|----------|  
| Instance state updates/sec | 20 updates/sec |  
| Trade execution events/sec | 50 events/sec |  
| Estimated data volume per day | ~20 MB/day |

## 🌐 **3. Scrape Interval Optimization**  
Scrape interval should balance between:  
- **Freshness** → Lower intervals provide real-time accuracy.  
- **Resource Usage** → Higher intervals reduce CPU and memory pressure.  

### ✅ **3.1. Recommended Scrape Interval:**  
| Service | Scrape Interval | Reason |  
|---------|-----------------|--------|  
| Redis (State + Execution) | `1s` | High-frequency updates |  
| Redis (Signal Stream) | `2s` | Signals are processed in batches |  
| DuckDB | `5s` | Writes and queries are less frequent |  
| Instance Manager | `10s` | Health checks are not time-sensitive |  
| Trade Engine | `1s` | High-frequency trades |  

### ✅ **Example Config:**  
```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 1s
  evaluation_interval: 1s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'redis'
    scrape_interval: 1s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['10.0.0.1:6379']

  - job_name: 'duckdb'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['10.0.0.2:1234']

  - job_name: 'instance-manager'
    scrape_interval: 10s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['10.0.0.3:4000']
```

## 🛠️ **4. Storage Optimization**  
Prometheus’ storage is write-intensive because of high-frequency state updates and signal streams. We need to tune the storage layer for:  
✅ Efficient ingestion  
✅ Fast query execution  
✅ Low disk I/O and fragmentation  

### ✅ **4.1. Retention Period:**  
| Data Type | Retention Period | Rationale |  
|-----------|------------------|-----------|  
| Redis State Data | 14 days | Short-term state data |  
| DuckDB Query Results | 30 days | Short-term query performance |  
| Trade Engine Logs | 30 days | Relevant for debugging and analysis |  

### ✅ **4.2. Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Optimization:**  
- Prometheus stores all data in the WAL before processing.  
- Adjust WAL size to balance between memory and disk.  

**Example Config:**  
```yaml
storage:
  tsdb:
    min_block_duration: 2h
    max_block_duration: 24h
    wal_segment_size: 64MB
    retention: 15d
```

### ✅ **4.3. Disk I/O Tuning:**  
- Use high-speed SSD storage (min 500 MB/s write).  
- Enable disk write caching.  
- Reduce fsync frequency to lower disk I/O pressure.

## ⚡ **5. Query Optimization**  
High-frequency queries can overload the system if not optimized:  
✅ Use recording rules to reduce computation load  
✅ Downsample historical data  
✅ Optimize query execution plans  

### ✅ **5.1. Recommended Recording Rules:**  
Example recording rule to compute average trade state updates:  
```yaml
groups:
  - name: trade_state_rules
    interval: 5s
    rules:
      - record: trade_state_latency_avg
        expr: avg(rate(redis_trade_state_latency_us[5m]))
```

### ✅ **5.2. Downsampling Strategy:**  
| Data Type | Downsample Interval | Reason |  
|-----------|---------------------|--------|  
| Redis Trade State | 1 minute | Real-time state tracking |  
| Redis Trade Signal | 5 seconds | High-frequency signals |  
| Instance Manager State | 30 seconds | Less frequent updates |  
| Trade Engine Execution | 5 seconds | High-frequency trades |  

---

## 🚀 **6. Concurrency and Parallelism**  
Prometheus supports multithreading for increased ingestion and query performance:  
✅ Allocate threads according to available CPU cores  
✅ Set high-concurrency limits for Redis and Trade Engine  

### ✅ **Example Config:**  
```yaml
storage:
  tsdb:
    max_open_files: 1000
    max_concurrent: 8
    no_lockfile: true
```

---

## 🧠 **7. Compression Strategy**  
Prometheus compresses data using Snappy by default — switch to LZ4 for better compression and faster reads:  

### ✅ **Example Config:**  
```yaml
storage:
  tsdb:
    compression: lz4
```

---

## 🔥 **8. Memory Usage Optimization**  
Prometheus stores time-series data in memory — we need to manage memory pressure carefully:  
✅ Limit active series count  
✅ Reduce label cardinality  
✅ Limit memory cache size  

### ✅ **Example Config:**  
```yaml
storage:
  tsdb:
    max_series: 2000000
    max_samples_per_send: 1000
```

---

## ⚡ **9. Connection Pooling**  
Prometheus connections to Redis and DuckDB should use connection pooling:  
✅ Redis → 100 connections  
✅ DuckDB → 50 connections  

### ✅ **Example Config:**  
```yaml
remote_write:
  - url: "http://localhost:9090"
    remote_timeout: 30s
    max_samples_per_send: 1000
    max_concurrent_shards: 8
```

---

## 🚦 **10. Backoff and Retry Strategy**  
Prometheus should automatically retry connection failures using exponential backoff:  
✅ Start retry after 5 seconds  
✅ Increase retry time exponentially  
✅ Stop after 5 attempts  

### ✅ **Example Config:**  
```yaml
remote_write:
  - url: "http://localhost:9090"
    remote_timeout: 30s
    retry_on_http_429: true
    retry_on_http_500: true
    retry_max_interval: 60s
```

---

## 📊 **11. Scrape Sharding**  
To reduce Prometheus memory and CPU load, configure scrape sharding:  
✅ Use `external_labels` to define scrape targets  
✅ Divide Redis and DuckDB scraping across instances  

**Example Config:**  
```yaml
external_labels:
  job: "redis"
  instance: "10.0.0.1"
```

---

## ✅ **12. Example Final Config (Summary):**  
```yaml
storage:
  tsdb:
    retention: 15d
    max_open_files: 1000
    max_samples_per_send: 1000
    max_concurrent_shards: 8
    compression: lz4
scrape_interval: 1s
evaluation_interval: 1s
```

## ✅ **Summary**  
| Service | Status |  
|---------|--------|  
| Redis | Optimized | ✅ |  
| DuckDB | Optimized | ✅ |  
| Instance Manager | Optimized | ✅ |  
| Trade Engine | Optimized | ✅ |
