## ✅ **Prometheus Architectural Design – Backup and Recovery**  
This section outlines the **backup and recovery strategy** for Prometheus, focusing on securing and restoring time-series data, configurations, and recording rules. The goal is to minimize data loss and ensure quick recovery in case of failure or data corruption.

---

## 🚀 **1. Backup Goals**  
The backup strategy will aim to:  
✅ Preserve time-series data stored in the TSDB (Time Series Database)  
✅ Retain Prometheus configuration files and recording rules  
✅ Ensure backups are encrypted and stored securely  
✅ Automate backup scheduling and rotation  
✅ Ensure rapid recovery with minimal downtime  

---

## 🛠️ **2. Prometheus Backup Scope**  
Prometheus operates in a write-intensive environment — backups must account for:  

| Component | Type | Backup Frequency | Retention Policy |  
|-----------|------|------------------|------------------|  
| **TSDB Data** | Metrics | Incremental (every 15 minutes) | 7 days |  
| **Recording Rules** | Config | Daily | 30 days |  
| **Alerting Rules** | Config | Daily | 30 days |  
| **Scrape Configurations** | Config | Daily | 30 days |  
| **Logs** | Log Files | Daily | 7 days |  

---

## 🔄 **3. Backup Strategy**  
### ✅ **3.1. Time-Series Data Backup**  
Prometheus stores metrics in the TSDB, which uses a block-based format.  
- Each block contains a set of time-series samples.  
- New blocks are written every **2 hours** (default).  

**Backup Strategy:**  
✅ Snapshot-based backup using the Prometheus HTTP API.  
✅ Store backups in a dedicated S3-compatible storage (minio).  
✅ Use incremental backups to reduce storage load.  
✅ Rotate backups after 7 days to limit storage size.  

**Example Snapshot Backup:**  
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/api/v1/admin/tsdb/snapshot
```

---

### ✅ **3.2. Configuration Backup**  
Configuration files include:  
- `prometheus.yml` – Scrape configs  
- `recording_rules.yml` – Recording rules  
- `alerting_rules.yml` – Alerting rules  

**Backup Strategy:**  
✅ Store config backups in S3-compatible storage.  
✅ Versioning enabled → Retain last 30 days of backups.  
✅ Automate backup using `cron` job.  

**Example Config Backup Script:**  
```bash
tar -czvf /backups/prometheus-config-$(date +%F).tar.gz /etc/prometheus
```

**Example Cron Job:**  
```bash
0 2 * * * /scripts/backup_prometheus.sh
```

---

### ✅ **3.3. WAL (Write-Ahead Log) Backup**  
Prometheus uses a WAL file to handle transaction recovery after a crash.  
- WAL is stored in `data/wal`  
- Size is configurable (default = 64MB)  

**Backup Strategy:**  
✅ Include WAL in incremental backup (every 15 minutes).  
✅ Store WAL backups separately for rapid recovery.  

**Example WAL Backup:**  
```bash
cp -r /var/lib/prometheus/wal /backups/prometheus-wal-$(date +%F)
```

---

### ✅ **3.4. Log Files Backup**  
Prometheus logs critical information about:  
- Scrape failures  
- Alert evaluation failures  
- Connection issues  

**Backup Strategy:**  
✅ Rotate logs every 7 days using `logrotate`.  
✅ Include logs in daily backup.  

**Example Log Backup:**  
```bash
tar -czvf /backups/prometheus-logs-$(date +%F).tar.gz /var/log/prometheus
```

---

## 🔐 **4. Security for Backups**  
### ✅ **4.1. Encryption**  
All backups will be encrypted using **AES-256** before storage:  
- Keys stored securely in a secrets manager  
- Encrypt at rest and in transit  

**Example AES Encryption:**  
```bash
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in /backups/prometheus-data.tar.gz -out /backups/prometheus-data.tar.gz.enc -k $SECRET_KEY
```

---

### ✅ **4.2. Backup Storage Strategy**  
| Storage Type | Purpose | Retention |  
|--------------|---------|-----------|  
| **Local Disk** | Fast recovery for recent backups | 7 days |  
| **S3-Compatible Storage** | Long-term backup and versioning | 30 days |  

---

### ✅ **4.3. Access Controls**  
✅ Backups stored with least privilege access.  
✅ Only `prometheus-backup` service account allowed to access backups.  
✅ Use IAM-based access control for S3 storage.  

**Example S3 Access Policy:**  
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::prometheus-backups/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

---

## ⚡ **5. Recovery Strategy**  
Recovery strategy will focus on minimizing downtime and ensuring data consistency.  

### ✅ **5.1. Time-Series Data Recovery**  
1. Stop Prometheus  
2. Restore TSDB snapshots and WAL backups  
3. Restart Prometheus  

**Example Recovery Command:**  
```bash
cp -r /backups/prometheus-data-2025-03-23.tar.gz /var/lib/prometheus/
tar -xzvf prometheus-data-2025-03-23.tar.gz
```

---

### ✅ **5.2. Configuration Recovery**  
1. Stop Prometheus  
2. Restore configuration files from backup  
3. Restart Prometheus  

**Example Recovery Command:**  
```bash
tar -xzvf /backups/prometheus-config-2025-03-23.tar.gz -C /etc/prometheus/
systemctl restart prometheus
```

---

### ✅ **5.3. WAL Recovery**  
1. Stop Prometheus  
2. Restore WAL backup  
3. Restart Prometheus  

**Example Recovery Command:**  
```bash
cp -r /backups/prometheus-wal-2025-03-23 /var/lib/prometheus/wal/
systemctl restart prometheus
```

---

### ✅ **5.4. Log Recovery**  
1. Stop Prometheus  
2. Restore logs  
3. Restart Prometheus  

**Example Recovery Command:**  
```bash
tar -xzvf /backups/prometheus-logs-2025-03-23.tar.gz -C /var/log/prometheus/
systemctl restart prometheus
```

---

## 🚨 **6. Failure and Edge Case Handling**  
| Failure Type | Handling Strategy |  
|--------------|-------------------|  
| **Backup Failure** | Retry with exponential backoff (5, 10, 30, 60 seconds) |  
| **Backup Corruption** | Store checksum of each backup and verify integrity |  
| **Storage Quota Reached** | Automatically rotate oldest backups |  
| **Missing Backup File** | Use next available backup in sequence |  
| **Recovery Failure** | Trigger alert and notify on Slack |  

---

## 🔎 **7. Monitoring Backup and Recovery**  
Prometheus will self-monitor the backup process:  

| Metric | Description |  
|--------|-------------|  
| `prometheus_backup_success_total` | Number of successful backups |  
| `prometheus_backup_failure_total` | Number of failed backups |  
| `prometheus_backup_size_bytes` | Size of the last backup |  
| `prometheus_backup_duration_seconds` | Time taken for the last backup |  

**Example Alert:**  
```yaml
groups:
  - name: Backup
    rules:
      - alert: BackupFailed
        expr: prometheus_backup_failure_total > 0
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Prometheus backup failed"
```

| Backup Component | Frequency | Retention | Strategy |  
|------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|  
| TSDB Data | 15 mins | 7 days | Incremental |  
| Config Files | Daily | 30 days | Full |  
| Logs | Daily | 7 days | Rotating |
