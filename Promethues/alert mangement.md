## ✅ **Prometheus Alerting Design (Refined for Redis, DuckDB, Instance Manager, and Trade Engine)**  
We’ll now refine the **Prometheus alerting design** to cover:  
- **Redis** – Trade State, Instance State, Signal Stream, Result Stream  
- **DuckDB** – Data consistency, query failures, memory usage  
- **Instance Manager** – Process health, resource usage, socket connections  
- **Trade Engine** – Trade execution, latency, and system-level failures  

The goal is to:  
✅ Detect failures and state inconsistencies in real-time  
✅ Monitor trade execution performance  
✅ Recover from system-level failures automatically where possible  
✅ Generate targeted alerts to notify the user/admin  

---

## 🚀 **1. Redis Alerting Strategy**  
Since Redis is handling real-time trading data and state, we need immediate detection and recovery from failures or degraded performance.

### ✅ **1.1. Redis-Trade-State (RTS) Alerts**  
| Alert Type | Trigger Condition | Action | Severity |  
|------------|------------------|--------|----------|  
| **High Trade State Latency** | `latency_us > 5000` (5ms) | Notify and investigate | Warning |  
| **High Trade State Retrieval Latency** | `retrieval_latency_us > 10000` (10ms) | Notify and investigate | Critical |  
| **State Consistency Failure** | State mismatch between Redis and DuckDB | Sync and alert | Critical |  
| **High Memory Usage** | `used_memory > 80%` for 30s | Notify and increase Redis memory allocation | Warning |  
| **Eviction Spike** | `evicted_keys > 100` within 1 minute | Notify and investigate | Warning |  
| **Connection Failure** | `connected_clients = 0` for 5s | Restart Redis instance | Critical |  

---

### ✅ **1.2. Redis-Instance-State (RIS) Alerts**  
| Alert Type | Trigger Condition | Action | Severity |  
|------------|------------------|--------|----------|  
| **Instance Failure** | `instance_failed` event received | Attempt auto-recovery | Critical |  
| **High CPU Usage** | `cpu_usage > 80%` for more than 10 seconds | Notify and throttle processes | Warning |  
| **High Memory Usage** | `memory_usage > 80%` for more than 10 seconds | Notify and attempt auto-recovery | Warning |  
| **High Queue Length** | `queue_length > 100` | Throttle trade processing | Warning |  
| **High Load Average** | `load_average > 2.0` | Attempt to redistribute load | Warning |  
| **Recovery Failure** | `recovery_attempts > 3` | Stop instance and notify | Critical |  
| **Socket Failure** | `socket_connections = 0` for 5s | Attempt reconnection | Critical |  

---

### ✅ **1.3. Redis-Signal-Stream (RTSS) Alerts**  
| Alert Type | Trigger Condition | Action | Severity |  
|------------|------------------|--------|----------|  
| **Signal Drop Rate Spike** | `dropped_signals_total > 50` within 5 minutes | Notify and increase Redis throughput | Warning |  
| **High Processing Latency** | `signal_processing_latency > 5000ms` | Notify and investigate | Warning |  
| **Execution Backlog** | `pending_signals > 200` | Increase processing capacity | Critical |  
| **Connection Failure** | `redis_tss_connection_errors_total > 10` | Restart Redis connection | Critical |  

---

### ✅ **1.4. Redis-Result-Stream (RTRS) Alerts**  
| Alert Type | Trigger Condition | Action | Severity |  
|------------|------------------|--------|----------|  
| **Result Sync Failure** | `sync_failures > 5` within 10 minutes | Attempt retry and notify | Critical |  
| **High Result Processing Latency** | `result_processing_latency > 5000ms` | Notify and investigate | Warning |  
| **Memory Leak** | `used_memory > 85%` | Restart Redis instance | Critical |  
| **High Result Drop Rate** | `dropped_results_total > 20` | Notify and investigate | Warning |  

---

## 📊 **2. DuckDB Alerting Strategy**  
Since DuckDB is responsible for local data consistency and transactional integrity, the alerting system will focus on:  
- Data consistency  
- Query failures  
- Memory and resource usage  

### ✅ **2.1. DuckDB Alerts**  
| Alert Type | Trigger Condition | Action | Severity |  
|------------|------------------|--------|----------|  
| **High Query Latency** | `query_duration_seconds > 2s` | Notify and investigate | Warning |  
| **High Memory Usage** | `used_memory > 80%` for 30s | Notify and increase memory allocation | Critical |  
| **Data Write Failure** | Write failure > 3 within 60 seconds | Retry and notify | Critical |  
| **Transaction Failure** | Failed transaction > 5 within 10 minutes | Notify and investigate | Warning |  
| **Disk Space Low** | `available_disk_space < 1GB` | Notify and stop writes | Critical |  

---

## 🧠 **3. Instance Manager Alerting Strategy**  
The Instance Manager will monitor MT5 instances and handle process-level alerts:  

### ✅ **3.1. Instance Manager Alerts**  
| Alert Type | Trigger Condition | Action | Severity |  
|------------|------------------|--------|----------|  
| **Instance Crash** | `instance_failed` event received | Attempt auto-recovery | Critical |  
| **High CPU Usage** | `cpu_usage > 80%` for more than 10 seconds | Notify and throttle processes | Warning |  
| **High Memory Usage** | `memory_usage > 80%` for more than 10 seconds | Notify and attempt auto-recovery | Warning |  
| **Socket Failure** | `socket_connections = 0` for 5s | Attempt reconnection | Critical |  
| **High Load Average** | `load_average > 2.0` | Attempt to redistribute load | Warning |  

---

## ⚡ **4. Trade Engine Alerting Strategy**  
Since the Trade Engine is handling high-frequency execution, trade-related alerts will focus on performance and failure handling:  

### ✅ **4.1. Trade Engine Alerts**  
| Alert Type | Trigger Condition | Action | Severity |  
|------------|------------------|--------|----------|  
| **Execution Failure** | Failed trade > 3 within 60 seconds | Retry and notify | Critical |  
| **Trade Slippage Spike** | Slippage > 10% on more than 5 trades within 5 minutes | Notify and adjust spread settings | Warning |  
| **Trade Latency Spike** | Execution latency > 5s | Notify and investigate | Warning |  
| **High Trade Volume** | Trade volume > 500 trades/minute | Notify and throttle processing | Warning |  
| **Network Disconnection** | `network_failure > 1` | Attempt reconnect and notify | Critical |  
| **Broker Failure** | `broker_connection_failure > 1` | Notify and attempt reconnect | Critical |  

---

## 🚦 **5. Notification Strategy**  
### ✅ **5.1. Notification Channels**  
- **Slack** → Trade state failures, trade execution issues  
- **Email** → Process-level and infrastructure failures  
- **Webhook** → Send actionable alerts to the backend  

### ✅ **5.2. Alert Throttling**  
- Alerts will be throttled to prevent spam.  
- Example:  
   - Send a maximum of 5 alerts per minute for Redis failures  
   - Send a maximum of 3 alerts per minute for trade execution failures  

### ✅ **5.3. Recovery Alerts**  
Once an issue is resolved, Prometheus will send a recovery alert:  
Example:  
```
ALERT: High Redis Latency Resolved 
Latency has dropped below threshold (2ms)
```

---

## 🏆 **6. Example Prometheus Alert Rule (YAML)**  
Example Redis alert for high trade state latency:  
```yaml
groups:
  - name: redis-alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighTradeStateLatency
        expr: redis_trade_state_latency_us > 5000
        for: 10s
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "High trade state latency detected"
          description: "Trade state latency exceeded 5ms"
```

## ✅ **Summary**  
| Service | Alerts | Severity | Status |
|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| Redis | Trade state, execution state, memory | Critical | ✅ |  
| DuckDB | Query latency, transaction failures, memory | Critical | ✅ |  
| Instance Manager | CPU, memory, socket failures | Critical | ✅ |  
| Trade Engine | Execution failures, slippage, volume | Critical | ✅ |
