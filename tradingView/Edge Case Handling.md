## 🚨 **Trade Error Handling Strategy**  
### ✅ **1. Immediate User Notification for Trade Placement Errors**
1. TradingView sends order via WebSocket/REST → Backend processes order.
2. If the backend returns a trade error:  
   - ✅ TradingView receives an immediate response.  
   - ✅ Error message is shown directly on the TradingView interface.  
   - ✅ User is prompted to adjust order parameters (e.g., price, volume).  
   - ✅ User receives a detailed reason for the failure (mapped to MT5 error codes).  

---

### ✅ **2. Immediate Notification for Order Rejection by EA**
1. Backend sends order to EA via UDP/TCP.  
2. If EA rejects the order:  
   - ✅ EA returns error code immediately.  
   - ✅ Backend maps error to human-readable message.  
   - ✅ Backend sends response to TradingView in < **500ms**.  
   - ✅ TradingView displays error message + proposed correction.  

---

### ✅ **3. Handling Trade Placement Delays**
1. If trade placement exceeds 500ms:  
   - ✅ TradingView notifies user of delay.  
   - ✅ Backend attempts alternate broker or retry.  
2. If order is not executed within 1 second:  
   - ✅ Order is automatically rejected.  
   - ✅ User notified → Prompt to retry or cancel.  

---

### ✅ **4. Handling Trade Mismatch or State Failure**
1. If order execution succeeds but TradingView shows an error:  
   - ✅ Redis state is verified against backend state.  
   - ✅ TradingView state is resynced within **5 seconds**.  
   - ✅ If mismatch persists → Backend clears state and prompts user to retry.  

---

### ✅ **5. Trade Placement Retry Strategy (Refined)**
| Attempt | Retry Delay | Trigger | Max Attempts |
|---------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| **First Attempt** | Immediate | Initial order submission | 1 |
| **Second Attempt** | 500ms | After first failure | 2 |
| **Third Attempt** | 1 second | After second failure | 3 |
| **Final Attempt** | 2 seconds | After third failure | 4 |

- If all attempts fail → User notified immediately.  
- User prompted to either retry or cancel order.  
- Backend logs failure reason + order details for debugging.  

---

### ✅ **6. Human-Readable Error Feedback**  
- Backend will map MT5 error codes → Clear, actionable TradingView message.  
- Example:  
   - **TRADE_RETCODE_NO_MONEY** → "Insufficient balance to place trade."  
   - **TRADE_RETCODE_MARKET_CLOSED** → "Market closed — Unable to execute order."  
   - **TRADE_RETCODE_PRICE_CHANGED** → "Price changed — Please adjust the price and retry."  

---

### ✅ **7. UI Feedback Handling**  
- Error messages will appear as:  
   - ✅ **Inline notification** on order panel.  
   - ✅ **Pop-up notification** for high-priority errors (e.g., market closed).  
   - ✅ **Color-coding** – Red for critical errors; yellow for warnings.  
- TradingView panel will allow:  
   - ✅ **Retry** button.  
   - ✅ **Cancel** button.  
   - ✅ **Modify order** option (if applicable).  

---

### ✅ **8. Order Rejection Handling in Redis (RTSS)**  
- If order is rejected:  
   - ✅ RTSS immediately clears the order state.  
   - ✅ Redis logs rejection reason and error code.  
   - ✅ Backend clears any pending trade state in RTSS.  

---

### ✅ **9. Handling Broker-Specific Trade Rules**  
- If broker-specific rules prevent trade execution:  
   - ✅ Backend retrieves the rule violation reason.  
   - ✅ TradingView displays the rule violation message.  
   - ✅ User prompted to adjust order (or select alternate broker).  
   - ✅ Redis state reset for clean retry.  

---

### ✅ **10. Handling Partial Fills**
1. If a trade is partially filled:  
   - ✅ TradingView shows partial execution state.  
   - ✅ User notified of partial execution.  
   - ✅ Backend monitors remaining volume for completion or timeout.  
   - ✅ Redis state updated continuously with execution state.  

---

### ✅ **Recovery Strategy for Trade Errors**
| Failure Point | Recovery Action | Impact |
|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Backend Rejects Trade** | Prompt user to adjust order | Minimal |
| **EA Rejects Trade** | Return error immediately to user | Minimal |
| **Network Drop During Trade** | Retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts) | Minor |
| **Partial Fill** | Monitor for completion or prompt user to retry | Minimal |
| **Trade Mismatch** | Redis resyncs state with backend | Minimal |
| **Market Closure** | Display notification, allow cancel | None |

---

### 🚀 **Performance Targets (Revised)**
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Trade execution feedback | < **500ms** |
| Order rejection feedback | < **500ms** |
| Trade state update to TradingView | < **1 second** |
| State mismatch recovery | < **5 seconds** |
| Partial fill update | Real-time |

---

### 🎯 **Outcome**
✔️ Immediate and accurate user feedback for all trade errors.  
✔️ No silent order failures — user always knows order status.  
✔️ Reduced risk of order mismatch or double execution.  
✔️ Fast failure recovery without user confusion.  
✔️ Seamless state sync across TradingView, Redis, and backend.

# ✅ **TradingView Edge Case Handling**  
We will now cover the potential failure points, unexpected scenarios, and error states that may arise during TradingView operation and how the system will handle them.

---

## 🚨 **Objective**  
The TradingView Edge Case Handling design aims to:  
1. Ensure consistent state handling even when network failures or data mismatches occur.  
2. Prevent order duplication and inconsistency between Redis, backend, and TradingView.  
3. Gracefully handle signal drops, execution failures, and connectivity issues.  
4. Provide clear feedback to the user when errors occur without compromising system integrity.  

---

## 🌐 **Scope**  
| Edge Case Type | Affected Component(s) | Impact Level |
|---------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **Network Failure** | TradingView ↔ Backend ↔ EA ↔ Redis | High |
| **Signal Loss** | Redis (RTSS) ↔ EA ↔ Backend | High |
| **Order Rejection** | EA ↔ TradingView ↔ Redis ↔ Backend | Medium |
| **Trade Mismatch** | EA ↔ Redis ↔ TradingView | High |
| **Latency/Overload** | Redis ↔ TradingView ↔ EA ↔ Backend | Medium |
| **Session Expiry** | TradingView ↔ Backend | Low |
| **Unauthorized Access** | TradingView ↔ Backend ↔ Redis | High |

---

## ✅ **1. Network Failure (Backend Disconnect)**
### 📌 **Description:**  
- TradingView attempts to send an order signal, but the backend is unreachable due to network loss.  

### 🔎 **Root Cause:**  
- Backend server crash.  
- Network congestion.  
- Firewall/Cloudflare blocking the request.  

### 🚨 **Handling Strategy:**  
1. TradingView → EA trade signal sent directly over UDP/TCP.  
2. Backend connection loss triggers **reconnection attempt** every 5 seconds for up to **30 seconds**.  
3. Redis (RTSS) holds trade state until backend reconnects.  
4. If backend fails to reconnect after 30 seconds:  
   - ✅ User notified of backend failure.  
   - ✅ Redis state sync retries automatically every 60 seconds.  
   - ✅ TradingView continues handling trade state from Redis.  

---

## ✅ **2. Network Failure (Redis Disconnect)**
### 📌 **Description:**  
- EA successfully sends trade to Redis, but Redis is temporarily unreachable from TradingView or backend.  

### 🔎 **Root Cause:**  
- Redis process crash.  
- Firewall/Network timeout.  
- Redis out of memory.  

### 🚨 **Handling Strategy:**  
1. Redis state saved to RDB/AOF snapshot.  
2. Redis auto-recovery from snapshot on restart.  
3. TradingView holds last known state from Redis.  
4. Backend holds active trade signals in memory for up to **60 seconds**.  
5. If Redis reconnects within 60 seconds:  
   - ✅ State resyncs from backend → Redis → TradingView.  
   - ✅ RTSS clears successful trade states.  

---

## ✅ **3. Order Rejection**  
### 📌 **Description:**  
- User places order from TradingView → Backend rejects due to invalid parameters.  

### 🔎 **Root Cause:**  
- Price slippage.  
- Trade volume limit.  
- Order type mismatch.  

### 🚨 **Handling Strategy:**  
1. Backend validates order parameters → Rejection returned to TradingView.  
2. TradingView alerts user → Order form reopens for adjustment.  
3. Redis (RTSS) state cleared for rejected order.  

---

## ✅ **4. Trade Execution Mismatch**  
### 📌 **Description:**  
- Order status in TradingView doesn’t match state in Redis or backend.  

### 🔎 **Root Cause:**  
- EA executed order but Redis failed to update.  
- Redis updated but backend failed to confirm.  
- TradingView connection dropped during order execution.  

### 🚨 **Handling Strategy:**  
1. Backend resyncs trade state from Redis → TradingView.  
2. If Redis/Backend mismatch persists after 3 attempts:  
   - ✅ Backend invalidates trade state.  
   - ✅ User notified of state mismatch.  
   - ✅ User prompted to manually refresh state.  

---

## ✅ **5. Trade Signal Loss**  
### 📌 **Description:**  
- Trade signal sent from TradingView → Lost in transit before Redis or backend receives it.  

### 🔎 **Root Cause:**  
- UDP packet loss.  
- Backend timeout.  

### 🚨 **Handling Strategy:**  
1. TradingView retransmits order using TCP after **500ms** timeout.  
2. If TCP fails → Retry with exponential backoff:  
   - ✅ 1st attempt → 1 second  
   - ✅ 2nd attempt → 2 seconds  
   - ✅ 3rd attempt → 4 seconds  
3. If signal not received after 3 retries → TradingView notifies user of connection failure.  

---

## ✅ **6. Session Expiry**  
### 📌 **Description:**  
- User session expires during order execution.  

### 🔎 **Root Cause:**  
- JWT expiration.  
- CSRF token mismatch.  

### 🚨 **Handling Strategy:**  
1. TradingView alerts user to re-login.  
2. Active trades held in Redis → Not affected by session expiry.  
3. On successful re-login → State resync from Redis → TradingView.  

---

## ✅ **7. High Tick Volume**  
### 📌 **Description:**  
- EA sends excessive tick data → TradingView lags or disconnects.  

### 🔎 **Root Cause:**  
- High tick frequency for volatile pairs.  
- Redis memory pressure.  

### 🚨 **Handling Strategy:**  
1. Redis `maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru` activated.  
2. UDP continues sending high-frequency ticks → TradingView handles only last 5 ticks.  
3. Redis clears overflow data using `volatile-lru` policy.  
4. TradingView throttles tick display rate if update exceeds **100 ticks/sec**.  

---

## ✅ **8. Order Placement Overload**  
### 📌 **Description:**  
- User places too many orders in short period → Backend or Redis overload.  

### 🔎 **Root Cause:**  
- Scalping behavior.  
- Trading bot automation.  

### 🚨 **Handling Strategy:**  
1. Backend rejects order beyond rate limit → TradingView notifies user.  
2. Redis temporarily blocks high-frequency orders for **5 seconds**.  
3. If overload persists → User’s session rate limited for **30 seconds**.  

---

## ✅ **9. Order Execution Delay**  
### 📌 **Description:**  
- TradingView sends order → Execution takes longer than expected.  

### 🔎 **Root Cause:**  
- Market slippage.  
- Broker-side network congestion.  

### 🚨 **Handling Strategy:**  
1. Backend monitors execution latency.  
2. If latency exceeds 1 second → Backend retries execution via alternate broker.  
3. If execution delay persists → Backend cancels order + notifies user.  

---

## ✅ **10. Signal Duplication**  
### 📌 **Description:**  
- TradingView sends duplicate signal to Redis → Double execution risk.  

### 🔎 **Root Cause:**  
- User click spam.  
- WebSocket reconnect issue.  

### 🚨 **Handling Strategy:**  
1. Redis validates signal UUID before processing.  
2. If duplicate UUID → Redis rejects the second signal.  
3. TradingView alerts user → Ignores duplicate signal.  

---

## 🚑 **Recovery Strategy**  
✅ Redis failure → Redis reloads state from AOF/RDB → Backend syncs with Redis.  
✅ TradingView disconnect → WebSocket auto-reconnects in 5 seconds.  
✅ Trade signal mismatch → Backend resyncs TradingView state from Redis.  
✅ High trade volume → Rate limiting + Redis memory eviction.  

---

## 🎯 **Performance Targets**  
| Edge Case | Target Handling Time |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| **Network Loss** | Recovery within **10 seconds** |
| **Order Execution Delay** | <1 second |
| **Session Expiry** | Re-login within **3 seconds** |
| **Signal Loss** | Recovery within **500ms** |
| **Trade Execution Mismatch** | Resync within **5 seconds** |
| **High Tick Volume** | Redis evicts data within **100ms** |

---

## ✅ **Conclusion**  
The edge case handling design ensures:  
✔️ High reliability under heavy load.  
✔️ Graceful failure handling.  
✔️ Immediate recovery with minimal downtime.  
✔️ Low latency for high-frequency tick data.  
✔️ Strong state consistency between Redis → Backend → TradingView.
