You're absolutely right — there’s a disconnect here. Let’s clarify the logic:

### ✅ **Goal of the Local Trading Panel Fallback**  
- The local trading panel **only becomes active** when TradingView itself is unreachable or unavailable.
- The purpose of the local panel is to allow the user to continue placing trades directly through the Rust Trade Engine (even if TradingView is down).  
- Therefore, the conditions that would **trigger the fallback** should **ONLY** be related to **TradingView connectivity** — **NOT** Redis, backend, or order state mismatches.

---

### ❌ **Incorrect Triggers:**  
Let's eliminate the following from the fallback criteria:  
❌ **Connection loss to backend or Redis** – Backend and Redis being down **should not** trigger fallback to the local panel, as they are not part of TradingView connectivity.  
❌ **Order execution failure for >3 attempts** – This is more of a backend-level issue and not directly linked to TradingView availability.  
❌ **WebSocket down for >10 seconds** – This is relevant only to backend or state sync issues, not TradingView itself.  
❌ **Backend unavailable for >10 seconds** – Backend failure should not affect TradingView state since Redis handles order state separately.  

---

### ✅ **Correct Fallback Triggers:**  
The **correct triggers** for the local trading panel should only include:  
✅ **TradingView widget disconnect** → If the TradingView WebSocket drops or TradingView itself becomes unresponsive.  
✅ **API request timeout** → If TradingView REST API calls for chart updates or order state retrieval timeout for more than **5 seconds**.  
✅ **Data mismatch** → If the Redis state and TradingView state become inconsistent for more than **5 seconds**.  
✅ **Failure to load chart** → If historical data or chart data retrieval fails repeatedly (indicating TradingView connection loss).  
✅ **Chart Render Error** → If TradingView itself cannot render due to resource limits or corrupted state.  

---

### 🚀 **Fixed Fallback State:**  
1. ✅ **Switch to Local Panel:**  
   - Stop tick streaming to TradingView.  
   - Only Redis → Rust Trade Engine flow will remain active.  
   - Redis and backend state continue running in the background.  

2. ✅ **Manual Recovery Mode:**  
   - User is notified that TradingView is down.  
   - User is shown an option to continue trading through the local panel.  

3. ✅ **Recovery Strategy:**  
   - Attempt to reconnect TradingView every **5 seconds**.  
   - Upon successful reconnection → Restore state sync from Redis.  
   - Sync order state and chart updates.  

---

### 🏆 **Why This Fix Matters:**  
- TradingView issues ≠ Backend or Redis issues.  
- Redis and backend failures do **NOT** justify switching to the local panel — because Redis and backend handle state independently.  
- If TradingView itself is down → We want the user to continue trading seamlessly using the Rust Trade Engine without interference from backend/Redis failures.

### ✅ **Finalized Fallback Triggers:**  
| Trigger | Action | Condition |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **TradingView widget disconnect** | Switch to local panel | Immediate |
| **API request timeout > 5s** | Notify + switch to local panel | After 5 seconds |
| **State mismatch > 5s** | Notify + switch to local panel | After 5 seconds |
| **Failure to load chart** | Notify + switch to local panel | After 3 attempts |
| **Chart render failure** | Notify + switch to local panel | After 3 failures |
