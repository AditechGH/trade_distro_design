### ✅ **TradingView Permissions and Security Handling**  
Now that we’ve locked down the TradingView flow, let’s cover permissions and security — ensuring secure data transmission, trade execution, and user-level protection.

---

## 🔒 **Objective**  
The TradingView permissions and security design aims to:  
1. Prevent unauthorized access to trade execution.  
2. Secure tick data transmission between EA ↔ Redis ↔ TradingView.  
3. Implement user-level authentication and role-based permissions.  
4. Protect TradingView from data leaks and data manipulation.  
5. Ensure data integrity and trade consistency across all connected components.

## 🌐 **Component Overview**  
| Component | Purpose | Type | Security Strategy |
|-----------|---------|------|------------------|
| **TradingView Widget** | Displays real-time data, order book, and allows trading | Frontend | JWT-based session control, CORS |
| **Redis (RTS, RTSS)** | Trade state + signal storage | Local | IP whitelisting, password-protected |
| **Backend** | Trade signal processing | Cloud | TLS + OAuth2 |
| **EA** | Tick data producer and trade executor | Local | Protected socket connection, IP-bound |

---

## 🚀 **Permissions Strategy**  
### ✅ **1. User Authentication**  
**Method:**  
- JWT-based authentication for TradingView.  
- User must be authenticated to access charting and order placement.  
- JWT contains:  
   - User ID  
   - Session expiry  
   - Allowed permissions  
   - Cryptographic signature  

**Implementation:**  
- JWT issued by backend upon login.  
- TradingView reads the JWT and sets session context.  
- JWT refreshed via silent authentication every 30 minutes.  

---

### ✅ **2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
**Roles:**  
- **Admin** → Full permissions for trade execution + charting.  
- **Trader** → Allowed to execute trades, view charts.  
- **Viewer** → Read-only access to charting and order book.  
- **Guest** → No access to order placement; view-only.  

| Role | Tick Data | Order Book | Trade Execution | Configuration Update |
|------|-----------|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Admin** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Trader** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Viewer** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Guest** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

---

### ✅ **3. IP Whitelisting**  
- Redis (RTSS + RTS) will be bound to `127.0.0.1` (local-only).  
- TradingView widget will communicate with backend over TLS.  
- Backend → MT5 communication restricted to backend’s internal IP range.  

---

### ✅ **4. API Token and Rate Limiting**  
- TradingView → Backend authenticated using OAuth2 API Token.  
- Each token is bound to the user’s session and role.  
- Backend enforces:  
   - ✅ **5 trades/sec per user**  
   - ✅ **100 API calls/min per user**  
   - ✅ **Auto-block on repeated abuse**  

---

### ✅ **5. Session Management**  
- JWT tokens expire after **30 minutes** of inactivity.  
- Session renewal via silent authentication.  
- User is logged out after **3 failed attempts**.  

---

## 🚨 **Security Strategy**  
### ✅ **1. Data Encryption**  
- ✅ TLS 1.3 enforced for all TradingView → Backend communication.  
- ✅ Redis (RTS/RTSS) traffic is encrypted using stunnel.  
- ✅ TCP uses encrypted binary protocol for Redis communication.  

---

### ✅ **2. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**  
- ✅ CORS only allows known TradingView domains.  
- ✅ Prevents unauthorized third-party web app embedding.  

---

### ✅ **3. CSRF Protection**  
- ✅ Anti-CSRF tokens used for order execution.  
- ✅ CSRF tokens rotate every **5 minutes**.  
- ✅ All write requests require CSRF token validation.  

---

### ✅ **4. ClickJacking Protection**  
- ✅ X-Frame-Options: `SAMEORIGIN` – Prevents TradingView from being loaded in an iframe.  
- ✅ Content-Security-Policy (CSP): `frame-ancestors` set to known TradingView domains only.  

---

### ✅ **5. State Consistency Protection**  
- ✅ Trade states are validated after execution.  
- ✅ Redis holds the last known state for consistency checks.  
- ✅ Backend verifies Redis state → TradingView state sync every 10 seconds.  
- ✅ If state mismatch → Sync state from backend to Redis → Redis to TradingView.  

---

### ✅ **6. Socket Connection Protection**  
- ✅ WebSocket → TradingView connection bound to session context.  
- ✅ If session expires → WebSocket terminates.  
- ✅ Connection failure triggers retry + auto-reconnect.  
- ✅ Throttling applied if connection is reattempted more than **5 times** in 10 seconds.  

---

## 🚨 **Edge Cases**  
| Edge Case | Handling Strategy | Impact |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| **Session Expiry** | TradingView session auto-expires after 30 minutes → Silent renewal or logout | Short-term data loss until login |
| **Redis Outage** | TradingView holds last known state → Syncs when Redis reconnects | Short-term state inconsistency |
| **IP Blacklisting** | Repeated failed login attempts → IP auto-blacklisted for 30 minutes | Temporary session loss |
| **JWT Manipulation** | Invalid JWT → TradingView session is terminated | User is logged out |
| **High Trade Volume** | Rate limiter blocks user for 30 seconds after exceeding limits | Minor order delay |
| **Unauthorized REST Calls** | Rejected with HTTP 403 → Security event logged | No impact on other users |
| **CSRF Token Mismatch** | REST call is rejected with HTTP 401 → CSRF token regenerated | User session requires re-authentication |

---

## 🏆 **Design Wins**  
✅ **TLS 1.3** – Latest encryption standard.  
✅ **RBAC** – Limits exposure to high-risk actions.  
✅ **Rate Limits** – Protects against abuse and DDoS.  
✅ **IP Whitelisting** – Local-only Redis → Reduces attack surface.  
✅ **Session Expiry + Rotation** – Prevents long-term session hijacking.  

---

## 🎯 **Performance Targets**  
| Target | Goal |
|--------|------|
| **Authentication Latency** | <50ms |
| **Tick Stream Latency** | <10ms |
| **Order Execution Latency** | <20ms |
| **Sync Consistency** | 100% |
| **Session Expiry** | 30 minutes |

---

## ✅ **Happy Path**  
1. User logs in to TradingView → JWT issued → Session established.  
2. Tick data streams from EA → Redis → TradingView over UDP/TCP.  
3. User places order → TradingView → Backend → MT5.  
4. Redis and backend state sync confirms trade success.  
5. TradingView reflects order status + account balance.  

---

## ✅ **Edge Case 1 – Session Expiry**  
1. User logs in.  
2. Session expires after 30 minutes of inactivity.  
3. User attempts to place order → JWT rejected → Prompted to log in again.  

---

## ✅ **Edge Case 2 – Network Loss**  
1. TradingView connection drops.  
2. Redis retains state + order.  
3. Connection restored → TradingView syncs with Redis state.  

---

## ✅ **Edge Case 3 – High Trade Volume**  
1. User places 10 orders in 5 seconds.  
2. Rate limit activated → Rejects additional requests.  
3. User notified to slow down.  

---

## 🚨 **Potential Loopholes + Mitigations**  
| Loophole | Risk | Mitigation |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **JWT Leakage** | Token leak could allow session hijacking | Rotate JWT every 30 minutes + secure storage |
| **CSRF Forgery** | CSRF token reuse could allow rogue trades | Rotate CSRF tokens + validation on server side |
| **High Tick Volume** | Could overload Redis | Memory eviction + rate limiting |
| **Unauthorized API Calls** | External API calls could bypass permissions | IP whitelisting + token-based authentication |

---

## ✅ **Conclusion**  
The TradingView security and permissions design ensures:  
✔️ Secure tick stream and order handling.  
✔️ Strong encryption + authentication.  
✔️ Strict rate limiting + abuse protection.  
✔️ Robust role-based permissions.  
✔️ Fault-tolerant and scalable.
