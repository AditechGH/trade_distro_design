## 🌐 **1. Network Layer Performance Tuning**  
✅ **Parallel Protocol Handling:**  
- UDP for low-latency delivery.  
- TCP for consistency and state validation.  
- Both UDP and TCP will transmit concurrently for consistent and fast updates.  

✅ **Priority-Based Protocol Handling:**  
- UDP packets take priority over TCP for tick streaming.  
- TCP packets are validated but not displayed until UDP packet is confirmed.  
- This reduces network congestion and minimizes packet loss impact.  

✅ **Compression for Large Data Payloads:**  
- Use **LZ4** compression for TCP transmission of large data sets (like historical data).  
- LZ4 is fast and has low CPU overhead.  
- Compression reduces network bandwidth without increasing latency.  

✅ **Keep-Alive Configuration:**  
- Enable `TCP_KEEPIDLE` = 10 seconds → Keep connection open for reuse.  
- Enable `TCP_KEEPINTVL` = 1 second → Fast reconnect if socket drops.  
- Keep UDP channels open at all times for real-time delivery.  

✅ **Socket Buffer Tuning:**  
- Increase `SO_RCVBUF` and `SO_SNDBUF` to handle high-throughput data.  
- Recommended value = **8MB** (adjust based on testing).  

---

## 💾 **2. Redis-Based Performance Tuning**  
✅ **Redis Stream Partitioning:**  
- Partition Redis Streams (`RTSS`, `RTRS`, `RTS`) across multiple Redis nodes.  
- Partitioning ensures high throughput and minimizes Redis bottlenecks.  

✅ **Pipeline and Batch Processing:**  
- Use Redis pipeline commands (`XADD`) for faster batch insertion.  
- Batch up to **100 ticks** before writing to Redis.  

✅ **Maxmemory Policy:**  
- `allkeys-lru` for RTSS and RTS → Evict oldest entries first to prevent memory overflow.  
- `volatile-lru` for RTRS → Evict oldest unacknowledged results first.  

✅ **Concurrency and Parallelism:**  
- Use `XREADGROUP` for concurrent stream reading.  
- Allocate dedicated threads for Redis stream handling.  

✅ **Minimize Key Creation:**  
- Reduce key creation events by using hash-based state storage.  
- Example: Use `HSET` for state rather than individual keys.  

---

## 📡 **3. TradingView Widget Rendering Optimization**  
✅ **Use GPU Rendering for Charting:**  
- Enable WebGL → Offload chart rendering to GPU.  
- GPU-based rendering reduces CPU load and improves responsiveness.  

✅ **Lazy Loading for Chart Data:**  
- Load visible data first (20 bars).  
- Prefetch next 100 bars in the background.  
- Load additional data on scroll events.  

✅ **Virtualized DOM for Large Datasets:**  
- Use virtual scrolling to render only visible chart elements.  
- Ensures TradingView can handle large datasets without UI lag.  

✅ **Debouncing for State Sync:**  
- Use debounce mechanism for state updates (limit to 10ms).  
- Avoid state thrashing from high-frequency Redis updates.  

✅ **Custom Canvas Layering:**  
- Separate chart rendering and state updates into different layers.  
- Improves rendering stability during high-frequency updates.  

---

## 🚀 **4. Backend Sync Performance Tuning**  
✅ **Use Dedicated Threads for Sync:**  
- Create separate thread pools for:  
   - Tick streaming  
   - Order state sync  
   - Historical data sync  

✅ **Batch-Based Sync for State Updates:**  
- Sync state every **500ms** or **after 50 trades** → Whichever comes first.  
- Use Redis `MULTI`/`EXEC` for transactional consistency.  

✅ **Memory-Efficient State Handling:**  
- Store state in Redis using `HSET` instead of individual keys.  
- Reduce memory pressure by only keeping active trades in memory.  

✅ **Direct Redis → TradingView Sync:**  
- Allow direct Redis-to-TradingView updates over WebSocket.  
- Minimize backend involvement for faster state propagation.  

---

## 🔎 **5. Historical Data Performance Tuning**  
✅ **Lazy Load Historical Data:**  
- Load initial chart data using pre-aggregated OHLC data from ClickHouse.  
- Prefetch additional data in the background.  

✅ **Separate Live vs Historical Data:**  
- Load historical data from ClickHouse.  
- Load live data from Redis → Merge in the frontend for seamless display.  

✅ **Use HTTP/2 for Faster Fetching:**  
- HTTP/2 supports multiplexing and reduces connection overhead.  
- Faster load times for historical data over HTTP/2.  

✅ **Cache Results in Browser:**  
- Use browser-side caching to store historical data.  
- Cache expiration: **5 minutes** for high-frequency data.  

---

## 🔄 **6. Order Processing Performance Tuning**  
✅ **Parallel Order Processing:**  
- Allow TradingView to place multiple orders concurrently.  
- Backend can process orders in parallel using separate threads.  

✅ **Direct State Update in Redis:**  
- Direct state update in Redis on order execution.  
- Backend sync confirms execution state for consistency.  

✅ **Optimize Order Execution Pipeline:**  
- Reduce processing latency using Redis pipelines.  
- Send orders using non-blocking Redis commands (`XADD`).  

---

## 🎯 **7. Concurrency and Parallelism Tuning**  
✅ **Socket Thread Pool:**  
- Create dedicated thread pool for:  
   - Tick streaming  
   - Order execution  
   - Historical data fetching  

✅ **WebSocket Scaling:**  
- Scale WebSocket connections horizontally using load balancer.  
- Distribute WebSocket load across multiple backend instances.  

✅ **Connection Pooling:**  
- Use Redis connection pooling to reduce connection latency.  
- Keep at least **100 active connections** open at all times.  

---

## 🛡️ **8. Memory Usage and Garbage Collection**  
✅ **Reduce Garbage Collection Pressure:**  
- Minimize object creation in TradingView rendering.  
- Use object pooling for tick data and order state.  

✅ **Memory Cap on Redis:**  
- Set `maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru` for Redis to cap memory usage.  
- Keep Redis memory usage below **70%** to prevent OOM events.  

✅ **Memory Profiling:**  
- Use `Chrome DevTools` for memory leak detection.  
- Run memory profiling during high-throughput trading sessions.  

---

## 🌎 **9. Load Balancing and Scalability**  
✅ **Horizontal Scaling for Backend:**  
- Add more backend instances for higher load.  
- Auto-scaling based on tick volume + order throughput.  

✅ **Socket Multiplexing:**  
- Use socket multiplexing for WebSocket connections.  
- Allow up to **500 concurrent connections** per backend instance.  

✅ **Redis Cluster Scaling:**  
- Configure Redis in cluster mode for horizontal scaling.  
- Partition Redis Streams by symbol or instance ID.
