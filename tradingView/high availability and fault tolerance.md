## 🔥 **TradingView High Availability and Fault Tolerance Design**  
We will now cover the **High Availability (HA)** and **Fault Tolerance (FT)** design for the TradingView service. This ensures that the system can continue to operate seamlessly during component failures, network issues, and high load scenarios.

---

## 🎯 **Objective**  
1. Ensure real-time tick data streaming continues even if part of the system fails.  
2. Minimize the impact of network disruptions and TradingView outages.  
3. Guarantee order execution consistency even if Redis or backend temporarily fails.  
4. Provide seamless user experience during failover and recovery.  

---

## 🚀 **Core Components Involved in HA/FT**  
| Component | Purpose | HA Strategy | FT Strategy |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **UDP/TCP** | Tick delivery and order execution | Redundant delivery paths | Automatic fallback + recovery |
| **Redis (RTSS, RTS)** | Tick and order state caching | In-memory replication | Data retention + recovery |
| **Backend** | Trade signal processing | Active-passive deployment | Automatic failover to Redis state |
| **TradingView** | Visualization + Trade Interface | Session persistence | Fallback to local trading panel |
| **EA** | Tick data + Trade execution | Multiple instances | Retry + reconnect |
| **ClickHouse** | Historical data + performance tracking | Clustered setup | Automatic rebalancing + recovery |

---

## 🏆 **High Availability Strategy**  
High Availability is about ensuring that the TradingView service remains operational even during:  
✅ **Component failure** (e.g., Redis crash, backend unavailability)  
✅ **Network failure** (e.g., connection loss between TradingView and backend)  
✅ **System overload** (e.g., high tick rate or large trade volume)  
✅ **Backend failure** (e.g., Python backend crashes)  

---

### ✅ **1. Tick Delivery Strategy**  
We will leverage a **parallel pathing strategy** for tick delivery:  
1. **UDP** → Primary path for low-latency streaming.  
2. **TCP** → Backup path for consistency and state recovery.  

**✅ HA Handling:**  
- If UDP fails → TCP takes over immediately.  
- If TCP fails → Redis continues holding state → Resync when TCP recovers.  

**✅ FT Handling:**  
- Redis will store the last known state → On reconnect, the last tick data will sync automatically.  
- TCP ensures consistency even if UDP drops packets.  

---

### ✅ **2. Redis Strategy**  
Redis is critical for:  
- Holding tick and trade state (RTS + RTSS).  
- Handling backpressure and message ordering.  
- Synchronizing state back to TradingView and backend.  

**✅ HA Handling:**  
- Redis configured with **Sentinel** for automatic failover.  
- Redis replication → Master → Follower setup.  
- If Redis instance fails → Redis Sentinel promotes follower → Automatic recovery.  

**✅ FT Handling:**  
- Redis `AOF` (Append-Only File) for disk-based recovery.  
- Redis eviction policy:  
   - Tick data → `allkeys-lru` (fastest)  
   - Trade state → `volatile-lru` (retain until order is settled)  

---

### ✅ **3. Backend Strategy**  
The backend handles:  
- Order execution tracking.  
- Trade signal validation.  
- Historical data retrieval.  

**✅ HA Handling:**  
- Backend operates in an **active-passive** configuration.  
- If the primary backend fails → Secondary instance takes over.  
- Heartbeat monitoring → Failover within **500ms**.  

**✅ FT Handling:**  
- If the backend fails → Redis holds the state.  
- When backend recovers → It pulls state from Redis and syncs back to TradingView.  
- Historical data backfill from ClickHouse → Rebuild missing state.  

---

### ✅ **4. TradingView Strategy**  
TradingView handles charting and order placement:  
- UI-level session management.  
- Order validation and state sync.  

**✅ HA Handling:**  
- Session token caching → If TradingView drops → User reconnects without losing state.  
- Order placement remains available using Redis state → Orders synced once TradingView reconnects.  

**✅ FT Handling:**  
- If TradingView is unavailable → User switches to local trading panel.  
- Redis holds state → Once TradingView reconnects → Resync from Redis.  

---

### ✅ **5. EA Strategy**  
EA handles real-time tick data generation and order placement:  
- Reads data from MT5.  
- Places trade orders using internal state.  

**✅ HA Handling:**  
- If EA crashes → Restart automatically using Windows Service.  
- MT5 logs last known state → EA picks up from there.  
- Redis holds state → EA resyncs once it restarts.  

**✅ FT Handling:**  
- If EA fails → Orders are held in Redis.  
- EA reconnects and processes missing orders from Redis.  
- State consistency guaranteed by Redis.  

---

### ✅ **6. ClickHouse Strategy**  
ClickHouse stores historical data and performance tracking:  
- Processes order execution logs.  
- Provides backfill for historical chart data.  

**✅ HA Handling:**  
- ClickHouse is set up in a **single-node active-passive** configuration.  
- If the primary node fails → Backup node promoted automatically.  
- Data backfill from DuckDB if ClickHouse instance is lost.  

**✅ FT Handling:**  
- If ClickHouse fails → Redis and backend store state temporarily.  
- ClickHouse recovers → Data synced from Redis and backend.

## 🔥 **High Availability Flow Summary**  
| Component | Strategy | Recovery Time | Path |
|-----------|----------|---------------|------|
| **Tick Streaming** | UDP → TCP fallback | <1ms | Direct from Redis |
| **Order Execution** | Retry with backoff | <1ms | Redis holds state → Backend retries |
| **State Synchronization** | Redis Sentinel + replication | <500ms | Redis recovery path |
| **Backend Failure** | Active-passive backend | <500ms | Secondary backend |
| **TradingView Crash** | Session recovery | <2s | User reconnects |
| **EA Crash** | Restart + state sync | <500ms | Redis holds last known state |
| **ClickHouse Failure** | Active-passive recovery | <1s | Data from Redis + backend |

---

## 🚨 **Failure Paths and Resolutions**  
| Failure Type | Impact | Resolution |
|--------------|--------|------------|
| **UDP Failure** | Tick data loss | TCP fallback |
| **TCP Failure** | Tick consistency loss | Redis sync on reconnect |
| **Redis Crash** | State loss | Redis Sentinel recovers |
| **Backend Crash** | Trade sync loss | Redis holds state + retry |
| **EA Crash** | Tick generation loss | Restart EA + Redis recovery |
| **TradingView Crash** | User disconnect | Redis holds state → User reconnects |
| **ClickHouse Crash** | Historical data loss | Redis holds last state → Sync on reconnect |

---

## 🏆 **Key High Availability and Fault Tolerance Design Choices:**  
✅ Parallel tick streaming → UDP + TCP  
✅ Redis Sentinel for recovery  
✅ Backend active-passive recovery  
✅ ClickHouse backup path from Redis + DuckDB  
✅ TradingView session caching + reconnection  

---

## 🚑 **Failure Examples:**  
### Example 1: Redis Crash  
1. Redis crashes → Sentinel promotes new instance.  
2. Tick data buffered in memory → Sent to TradingView on recovery.  
3. State synced back to TradingView.  

---

### Example 2: EA Crash  
1. EA crashes → Windows Service restarts EA.  
2. Redis holds last known state.  
3. EA reconnects → Pulls state from Redis.  
4. TradingView reflects latest state.  

---

### Example 3: Backend Crash  
1. Backend crashes → Redis holds signal state.  
2. TradingView holds session state.  
3. Backend recovers → Redis sends state update.  

---

## 📊 **Performance Targets:**  
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| **Tick Streaming Latency** | <10ms |
| **Order Execution Latency** | <20ms |
| **Backend Failover** | <500ms |
| **Redis Recovery** | <500ms |
| **EA Restart** | <500ms |
| **ClickHouse Failover** | <1s |

---

## 🔥 **Why This Works:**  
✔️ Independent failure paths = No single point of failure.  
✔️ Fast recovery using Redis + Sentinel + Active-Passive backend.  
✔️ Parallel UDP/TCP ensures low-latency tick delivery.  
✔️ Redis ensures consistent state even under network failure.  
✔️ ClickHouse holds historical state — Redis handles real-time state.  

---

## ✅ **Conclusion:**  
This high availability and fault tolerance design ensures that:  
✔️ Tick data continues streaming even under failure.  
✔️ Orders remain consistent even if the backend fails.  
✔️ EA + Redis handle failover without losing trade state.  
✔️ TradingView remains consistent under high load or network failure.
