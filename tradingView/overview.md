### ✅ **TradingView Architectural Design Outline**  
We will now cover the TradingView service, which will serve as the frontend visualization and trade execution layer of the Trade Distribution System.

---

## 🔎 **Objective**  
The TradingView service is designed to:  
1. Display real-time tick data and order book (if available).  
2. Allow the user to place trades through the TradingView interface.  
3. Synchronize trade execution status back to TradingView (position size, PnL, stop-loss/take-profit).  
4. Provide interactive charting features with historical and real-time data.  
5. Allow user configuration and customization from the TradingView interface.

## 🌐 **Components Involved**  
| Component | Purpose | Type | Frequency |
|-----------|---------|------|------------|
| **EA** | Tick producer, trade executor | Local | Millisecond-level |
| **Redis (RTSS, RTS)** | Tick and order state cache | Local | Immediate |
| **Backend** | Trade signal handler | Cloud | Batch-based (500ms) |
| **TradingView Widget** | Charting and trade panel | Frontend | Immediate |

---

## 🚀 **Key Functions**  
| Function | Description | Data Source | Protocol |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Tick Streaming** | Tick data pushed to TradingView chart | Redis (RTS) → TradingView | UDP + TCP |
| **Order Execution** | User places order from TradingView → Routed to backend → EA executes | TradingView → Backend → EA | WebSocket (Primary) + REST (Backup) |
| **State Synchronization** | Open positions and order status updated live on TradingView | Redis (RTS) → TradingView | WebSocket |
| **Chart History** | Load historical chart data for the current pair | Backend → TradingView | REST + WebSocket |
| **Order Book** | Real-time order book display | Redis (RTSS) | WebSocket + UDP |

---

## 🔄 **Data Flow**  
### ✅ **1. Tick Streaming**  
1. EA generates tick data in real-time.  
2. EA writes tick to **Redis (RTS)** using `HSET`.  
3. Redis pushes the tick data to TradingView over:  
   - ✅ **UDP** → Primary (low-latency)  
   - ✅ **TCP** → Fallback and consistency (if UDP packet drops)  
4. TradingView widget displays live tick updates.  

---

### ✅ **2. Order Execution**  
1. **TradingView → UDP/TCP → MT5 Distribution:**  
   - TradingView sends the signal via WebSocket (primary) or REST (backup).  
   - Signal is concurrently sent to **MT5** using **UDP/TCP** (for immediate execution).  
   - ✅ If UDP arrives first → TCP reinforces it (ensuring consistency).  

2. **TradingView → Backend:**  
   - TradingView sends the signal to the backend over WebSocket.  
   - Backend validates and processes the signal independently from MT5.  
   - If the signal fails to execute → Backend handles failure recovery or retry logic.  

3. **TradingView → RTSS:**  
   - Signal is stored in **RTSS** to track execution state.  
   - RTSS holds the trade until:  
      - All MT5s respond (or timeout).  
      - Backend confirms successful processing.  
   - RTSS drops the signal only when:  
      - ✅ All MT5 instances have responded.  
      - ✅ Backend has confirmed the outcome.  

4. **MT5 Distribution → RTS:**  
   - Upon successful execution, MT5 state is written to **RTS** using `HSET`.  
   - RTS holds the current state of each trade and is used for state recovery and real-time sync.   
5. EA executes order and sends execution state to Redis (RTS).  
6. Redis syncs execution state back to TradingView.  

---

### ✅ **3. State Synchronization**  
1. EA sends state updates to Redis (RTS).  
2. Redis pushes state updates to TradingView over **WebSocket**.  
3. TradingView updates chart + trade panel.  

---

### ✅ **4. Chart History**  
1. TradingView requests historical data on pair load.  
2. Backend queries historical data from ClickHouse.  
3. Backend sends response over **WebSocket** or **REST**.  
4. TradingView loads chart history.  
5. EA handles live data after historical data is loaded.  


---

## 🏗️ **Concurrency Strategy**  
✅ Redis Streams (`XADD`) for real-time tick handling.  
✅ Redis Streams (`XREADGROUP`) for order state.  
✅ High concurrency handling → Redis handles parallel streams with low latency.  
✅ UDP + TCP → Parallel transmission for consistency and speed.  
✅ Multiple user sessions supported simultaneously.  

---

## 🚨 **Edge Cases**  
| Edge Case | Handling Strategy | Impact |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| **UDP Packet Loss** | TCP fallback ensures consistency | Minimal latency increase |
| **Backend Disconnect** | Redis buffers state until backend reconnects | No data loss |
| **Tick Data Overload** | Redis evicts oldest ticks using `maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru` | Loss of old tick data |
| **Order Execution Delay** | Backend retries execution with exponential backoff | Minor delay |
| **Data Mismatch (Redis → TradingView)** | Backend resyncs state from Redis → TradingView | Short-term display error |
| **Network Loss (Backend → TradingView)** | Switch to TCP → Attempt recovery | Higher latency until recovery |
| **Historical Data Load Failure** | TradingView retries after 5 seconds | Short-term unavailability of historical data |

---

## 🔒 **Security Strategy**  
✅ **WebSocket over TLS** – Secures order transmission.  
✅ **Redis Protected Mode** – Binds Redis to `127.0.0.1` and requires authentication.  
✅ **User Permissions** – Read-only for charting; write permissions for order execution.  
✅ **CSRF Protection** – Protects WebSocket requests from hijacking.  
✅ **Rate Limits** – Limits on order requests and data requests.  
✅ **Session Timeout** – User sessions expire after inactivity.  

---

## 📊 **Metrics and Monitoring**  
| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `tv_tick_stream_latency` | Time from EA → Redis → TradingView | <10ms |
| `tv_order_execution_latency` | Time from TradingView order to execution | <20ms |
| `tv_order_state_sync_latency` | State sync latency from Redis → TradingView | <5ms |
| `tv_active_sessions` | Number of active TradingView user sessions | Scalable |
| `tv_order_execution_errors` | Number of failed order executions | <1% |
| `tv_historical_data_load_time` | Time to load historical data from ClickHouse | <500ms |
| `tv_rejected_orders` | Number of rejected orders due to validation failure | <1% |

---

## 🚑 **Recovery Strategy**  
✅ Redis failure → State resync from backend.  
✅ Backend failure → Redis caches state → Resync when backend reconnects.  
✅ Data mismatch → Backend resyncs from Redis and TradingView.  
✅ TradingView reconnects automatically after network drop.  
✅ Historical data re-requested if load failure occurs.  

---

## 🎯 **Performance Targets**  
✅ Tick streaming latency → **<10ms**  
✅ Order execution latency → **<20ms**  
✅ Order state sync → **<5ms**  
✅ Historical data load time → **<500ms**  

---

## ✅ **Happy Path**  
1. User loads TradingView widget → Chart populates historical data.  
2. EA sends live tick → Redis → TradingView (UDP + TCP).  
3. User places order → Backend → EA executes order.  
4. Order state updates reflected in Redis + TradingView.  
5. All data synchronized within **<20ms**.  

---

## ❌ **Edge Case 1 – Network Loss**  
1. User places order.  
2. Network drops after backend receives order.  
3. Redis buffers state.  
4. Backend reconnects → Resyncs state → TradingView updates state.  

---

## ❌ **Edge Case 2 – Tick Data Overload**  
1. EA sends large volume of ticks.  
2. Redis reaches memory limit.  
3. Redis evicts oldest data using `allkeys-lru` policy.  
4. TradingView reflects latest ticks, discards old ticks.  

---

## 🏆 **Design Goals**  
✅ Real-time tick streaming with parallel consistency.  
✅ Fast order execution.  
✅ Seamless state sync.  
✅ Secure and resilient to failure.  
✅ Scalable to support multiple user sessions.  

---

## ✅ **Conclusion**  
The TradingView service will be:  
✔️ Real-time and low-latency  
✔️ Consistent across all components  
✔️ Fault-tolerant with automatic recovery  
✔️ Scalable to thousands of users  
✔️ Secure with rate limiting and session protection

Shall we proceed to **Permissions and Security Handling** for TradingView? 😎

### 🔥 **Key Fix:**
✅ The signal in RTSS is not dependent on the backend’s validation → RTSS tracks **MT5 state only**.  
✅ If the backend fails but MT5 executes successfully → The signal is considered processed and removed from RTSS.  
✅ If MT5 execution fails but the backend still receives it → Retry strategy is triggered automatically.  

---

### ✅ **Why This Fix is Important:**
- It separates **MT5 execution state** from **backend processing state** → Prevents false failures.  
- RTSS is tightly focused on tracking execution state → It avoids getting bogged down by backend delays or issues.  
- Backend can handle order management (e.g., retries, failures) without affecting the core MT5 execution flow.  

---

This flow ensures the system is:  
✅ **Concurrent** – TV → UDP/TCP, Backend, and RTSS all happen simultaneously.  
✅ **Fast** – UDP ensures low-latency trade execution.  
✅ **Consistent** – TCP and RTS ensure eventual consistency.  
✅ **Reliable** – Backend failures or sync issues do not impact MT5 execution.

Shall we refine this or lock it down? 😎
