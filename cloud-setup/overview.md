This is a much cleaner and more secure approach. Exposing ClickHouse and PostgreSQL directly to the public can introduce security vulnerabilities and increase the risk of unauthorized access or performance issues due to direct user queries.

## ✅ **High-Level Architecture Overview**
### 🔹 **1. ClickHouse-node (Local Access Only)**
- Completely block from external/public access.
- Expose only to the backend service within the same network/VPC.
- Use `tcp_port` (9000) for internal queries.
- Use `http_port` (8123) if needed for internal HTTP API requests (Grafana, etc.).

### 🔹 **2. PostgreSQL-node (Local Access Only)**
- Block external access entirely.
- Only allow connections from the backend service.
- Ensure TLS is enabled for secure internal communication.
- Only open necessary ports (typically 5432).

### 🔹 **3. Backend Logic**
- Python-based service.
- Hosted on a separate instance in the same network.
- Acts as the single interface between the frontend and the data layer.
- Handles:
   - Authentication and subscription (→ PostgreSQL)
   - CRUD operations for MT5 instance credentials (→ PostgreSQL)
   - Syncing and data transformation (→ ClickHouse)
   - Monitoring and logging

## 🌐 **Network and Security Configuration**
1. **VCN (Virtual Cloud Network):**
   - Create a single VCN with a private subnet for ClickHouse and PostgreSQL.
   - Create a separate subnet for the backend service.

2. **Security Lists:**
   - Allow ClickHouse and PostgreSQL to receive traffic **only** from the backend instance.
   - Open specific ports:
     - **TCP 8123** – Backend → ClickHouse (HTTP API)
     - **TCP 9000** – Backend → ClickHouse (Native protocol)
     - **TCP 5432** – Backend → PostgreSQL (PG protocol)

3. **Firewall Rules:**
   - Disable ICMP from public sources (allow only internal communication for health checks).
   - Ensure the backend instance's public IP is blocked from direct database access.

## 🔧 **ClickHouse Configuration Changes**
1. **Block Public Access**:
   - Remove `0.0.0.0` from `listen_host`.
   - Replace with `127.0.0.1` or the backend's private IP address.
   
```xml
<listen_host>127.0.0.1</listen_host>
<listen_host>10.x.x.x</listen_host> <!-- Backend IP -->
```

2. **Enable Only Internal HTTP and TCP Ports**:
- Keep only internal ports open:

```xml
<http_port>8123</http_port>
<tcp_port>9000</tcp_port>
```

3. **Authentication and User Permissions**:
- Define a ClickHouse user **only for the backend** in `users.xml`:

```xml
<users>
    <backend_user>
        <password>secure-password</password>
        <networks>
            <ip>10.x.x.x</ip> <!-- Backend IP -->
        </networks>
    </backend_user>
</users>
```

## 🔧 **PostgreSQL Configuration Changes**
1. **Bind to Private Network Only**:
- Update `postgresql.conf`:

```text
listen_addresses = '10.x.x.x'  # Backend IP only
```

2. **Allow Internal Access Only**:
- Update `pg_hba.conf`:

```text
# TYPE  DATABASE    USER     ADDRESS           METHOD
host    all         backend  10.x.x.x/24       md5
```

## 🏗️ **Backend Design Notes**
1. **Backend handles authentication**:
   - JWT or OAuth-based.
   - Store user credentials securely in PostgreSQL.
   - Implement role-based access control.

2. **Sync Layer**:
   - Backend service sends data to ClickHouse via native protocol or HTTP API.
   - Batch inserts to minimize query load.

3. **Data Flow Example**:
- Frontend → Backend → PostgreSQL (Auth, Subscription, MT5 Credentials)
- Backend → ClickHouse (Data Sync)

---

## 🚀 **Next Step**
- Start by setting up the VCN and network configuration.
- Adjust ClickHouse and PostgreSQL configs.
- Define backend service architecture (Python microservice).
- Once we have the network and security in place, we can optimize ClickHouse for the backend query patterns.
