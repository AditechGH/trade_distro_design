## ✅ **EA Architectural Design Document: Performance Tuning**  
**Purpose:**  
This document outlines the performance tuning strategy for the Expert Advisor (EA) to ensure low latency, high throughput, and efficient handling of trade execution and tick data. Given that the EA will handle both trade execution and tick data processing concurrently, the tuning strategy will focus on:  
- Minimizing execution latency  
- Efficient memory management  
- High concurrency for real-time tick processing  
- Reducing CPU and network overhead  

---

## **1. Performance Objectives**  
The following key objectives will drive the performance tuning of the EA:  
✅ Ensure real-time processing of tick data with minimal latency.  
✅ Ensure fast and reliable trade execution with minimal slippage.  
✅ Maximize concurrency for handling multiple trade signals and ticks simultaneously.  
✅ Optimize memory and CPU usage to allow for efficient multi-instance handling.  

---

## **2. Tick Data Handling Performance Tuning**  
### ✅ **2.1. UDP/TCP Optimization**
Since UDP and TCP will handle tick data, optimizing the handling of both protocols will directly improve tick data processing efficiency.  

| **Metric** | **Tuning Strategy** | **Target** |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| UDP Packet Loss | Increase socket buffer size using `SO_RCVBUF` | Minimize dropped ticks |
| TCP Retransmissions | Adjust `tcp_retries2` to retry more aggressively | Minimize dropped ticks |
| UDP Processing Order | Ensure timestamp-based sorting for out-of-order packets | Process ticks in order |
| UDP Buffer Size | Use sliding window to limit memory usage | 64KB to 256KB |
| TCP Latency | Enable `TCP_NODELAY` to disable Nagle's algorithm | Minimize packet delay |
| UDP Throttling | Limit UDP burst rate if buffer overflows | Max 10ms burst window |

---

### ✅ **2.2. Buffer Size and Overwrite Strategy**
The EA will maintain a rolling buffer for tick data to reduce memory pressure and handle high-frequency ticks.  
**Strategy:**  
- Rolling buffer size → 1000 ticks  
- Oldest tick will be overwritten when buffer overflows  
- TCP data will **replace** UDP data to reduce inconsistencies  

**Tuning Goal:**  
✅ Target max buffer size → **256 KB**  
✅ Overwrite policy → **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**  
✅ Timestamp-based overwrite for consistency  

---

### ✅ **2.3. Memory Buffer Alignment**
Efficient memory alignment will reduce CPU cache misses and improve tick data processing.  

**Strategy:**  
- Allocate buffer memory in 64-byte blocks (aligned to cache line size)  
- Use `posix_memalign()` for aligned memory allocation  
- Use zero-copy network stack to avoid memory copy operations  

**Tuning Goal:**  
✅ Reduce cache misses → <1%  
✅ Reduce memory copy → Use direct memory access  

---

### ✅ **2.4. Tick Frequency and Processing Rate**
The EA will handle ticks at high frequency (potentially 50–100 ticks per second).  
**Strategy:**  
- Cap tick processing rate to avoid buffer overflow  
- Discard stale ticks if processing falls behind  
- Prioritize real-time ticks over historical ticks  

**Tuning Goal:**  
✅ Max tick rate → **100 ticks/second**  
✅ Processing lag → **<1ms**  
✅ Stale tick threshold → **100ms**  

---

### ✅ **2.5. Tick Transmission Throttling**  
To avoid overwhelming Redis or TradingView:  
- Throttle UDP transmission if Redis queue exceeds **1000 signals**  
- Throttle TCP transmission if buffer size exceeds **256KB**  

**Tuning Goal:**  
✅ Max Redis Queue Size → **1000 entries**  
✅ Max Buffer Size → **256KB**  
✅ Throttle Backoff → **10ms**  

---

## **3. Trade Execution Performance Tuning**  
### ✅ **3.1. Concurrency and Parallel Processing**
Trade execution will be processed in parallel with tick handling.  
**Strategy:**  
- Separate thread pool for trade execution (min **4 threads**)  
- Use non-blocking I/O for communication with broker  
- Handle order execution and confirmation asynchronously  

**Tuning Goal:**  
✅ Parallelism → **4 execution threads**  
✅ Execution concurrency → **2 trades/sec**  

---

### ✅ **3.2. Exponential Backoff Strategy**
Trade execution retry will use an exponential backoff strategy:  

- First failure → Retry after **1 second**  
- Second failure → Retry after **2 seconds**  
- Third failure → Retry after **4 seconds**  
- Cap retry attempts to **5**  
- Notify user after backoff limit reached  

**Tuning Goal:**  
✅ Max backoff time → **16 seconds**  
✅ Notify after → **5 attempts**  

---

### ✅ **3.3. Slippage Handling**  
Slippage will be tuned based on market conditions and user configuration.  

**Strategy:**  
- Allow user to configure max slippage  
- Cancel order if slippage exceeds threshold  
- Notify user and allow adjustment  

**Tuning Goal:**  
✅ Max allowed slippage → **0.5% of order size**  
✅ Real-time monitoring of slippage → Adjust threshold dynamically  

---

### ✅ **3.4. Order Placement Latency**
To minimize order placement latency:  
- Preload symbols and account data into memory  
- Use direct broker API for order placement  
- Enable asynchronous processing  

**Tuning Goal:**  
✅ Order latency → **<30ms**  
✅ Confirmation latency → **<100ms**  

---

## **4. Redis State Handling Performance Tuning**  
### ✅ **4.1. Redis Key Expiration**
To prevent Redis memory overflow:  
- Trade state data → No expiration  
- Closed trades → Expire after **30 days**  
- Alerts → Expire after **1 day**  

**Tuning Goal:**  
✅ Open trade expiration → **No expiration**  
✅ Closed trade expiration → **30 days**  
✅ Alert expiration → **1 day**  

---

### ✅ **4.2. Redis Throughput and Command Optimization**
To reduce Redis latency:  
- Use `pipeline` for bulk commands  
- Minimize `HSET` and `HGET` calls  
- Reduce `XADD` calls by batching signals  

**Tuning Goal:**  
✅ Max command rate → **1000 commands/sec**  
✅ Redis latency → **<1ms**  

---

### ✅ **4.3. Redis Stream Processing Rate**
Redis Stream for signals and results will be tuned to handle:  
- Signal ingestion rate → **1000 signals/sec**  
- Result ingestion rate → **100 signals/sec**  

**Tuning Goal:**  
✅ Signal rate → **1000/sec**  
✅ Result rate → **100/sec**  

---

## **5. Network and I/O Tuning**  
### ✅ **5.1. Socket Buffer Size**
Increase socket buffer size for UDP and TCP:  
- UDP → 256 KB  
- TCP → 512 KB  

**Tuning Goal:**  
✅ UDP buffer → **256 KB**  
✅ TCP buffer → **512 KB**  

---

### ✅ **5.2. Zero-Copy Networking**
Direct Memory Access (DMA) will be used to reduce CPU load:  
- Use `mmap()` for buffer allocation  
- Enable `SO_BUSY_POLL` for low-latency socket polling  

**Tuning Goal:**  
✅ Zero-copy handling → **Enabled**  
✅ DMA efficiency → **95%+ packet retention**  

---

### ✅ **5.3. Broker API Rate Limits**
To avoid hitting broker limits:  
- Implement per-second rate limit on order placement  
- Implement backoff on rate-limit breach  

**Tuning Goal:**  
✅ Max orders per second → **5**  
✅ Backoff after rate limit → **30 seconds**  

---

## **6. CPU and Memory Tuning**  
### ✅ **6.1. CPU Core Affinity**  
Pin execution threads to specific CPU cores to avoid context switching:  
- Trade execution → Cores 0–2  
- Tick processing → Cores 3–5  

**Tuning Goal:**  
✅ CPU pinning → Enabled  
✅ Context switching → **<10/sec**  

---

### ✅ **6.2. Memory Allocation and Paging**  
Use large pages for better memory handling:  
- Enable `transparent_hugepages`  
- Preallocate memory buffer to avoid fragmentation  

**Tuning Goal:**  
✅ Memory Fragmentation → **<5%**  
✅ Memory Allocation → **<1ms**
