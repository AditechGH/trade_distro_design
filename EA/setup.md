### ✅ **Expert Advisor (EA) Architectural Design**  
This document outlines the architectural design for the **MT5 Expert Advisor (EA)**, covering how it will handle trade placements, read tick data, and manage configuration updates.

---

## 1. **Purpose and Scope**
The EA will be designed to handle two primary functions:  
1. **Trade Placements** → Place, modify, and close trades based on user-defined configurations and trading signals.  
2. **Tick Data Handling** → Read and store tick-by-tick data into a memory buffer to support real-time analysis and trade execution in TradingView.  

### 📌 **Scope**:
- The EA will be lightweight and focused solely on trade execution and tick data handling.
- No charting or indicator logic will be embedded — all visualization and analysis will occur on TradingView.
- The EA will operate with minimal overhead to support running 100+ instances concurrently.

---

## 2. **Input and Output**  
| **Component** | **Source** | **Format** | **Destination** |
|--------------|------------|------------|----------------|
| Trade Signal | TradingView via Redis (RTSS) | JSON | EA (via memory buffer) |
| Configuration | User settings (DuckDB → Redis) | JSON → Struct | EA (via in-memory) |
| Tick Data | Broker feed (MT5) | Tick-by-tick | Memory Buffer |
| Trade Result | MT5 Result | Struct → JSON | Redis (RTRS) → Backend → DuckDB → ClickHouse |
| State Sync | Instance Manager | JSON → Struct | Redis (RIS) → Prometheus |

---

## 3. **EA Functional Design**  

### 🚀 **3.1. Trade Placement**
The EA will handle the following trade operations:  
✅ Open order  
✅ Modify order  
✅ Close order  
✅ Adjust stop-loss/take-profit  
✅ Manage trailing stops  

### 🔄 **Trade Placement Flow**  
1. EA listens for trade signals from Redis RTSS.
2. EA processes the trade signal.  
3. EA validates order type, price, volume, and other parameters.  
4. EA sends trade request to MT5 trade server via `OrderSend()`.  
5. EA logs the result in Redis RTRS and the local memory buffer.  
6. If successful → EA updates trade state in Redis RTS.  
7. If failed → EA returns error code to Redis RTRS.  

---

### 📈 **3.2. Tick Data Handling**  
✅ EA listens for tick data from the broker continuously.  
✅ Tick data is stored in a ring buffer (in-memory).  
✅ Tick data is pushed to Redis RTS and made available to TradingView.  
✅ Tick data is only stored while trades are active — not stored permanently.  

---

### 🔄 **3.3. Trade State Synchronization**  
1. EA periodically updates trade state in Redis RTS.  
2. Trade state includes:  
   - Account balance  
   - Equity  
   - Margin level  
   - Open positions  
   - Order status  
3. If Redis connection fails → EA retries based on backoff strategy.  

---

### 🛠️ **3.4. Configuration Handling**  
✅ EA accepts configuration updates at runtime:  
- Trade lot size  
- Maximum drawdown  
- Maximum open orders  
- Trailing stop settings  
✅ Configuration is stored in Redis → EA pulls updates every 500ms.  

**Configuration Update Flow:**  
1. User updates configuration in the UI (DuckDB).  
2. Configuration is synced to Redis.  
3. EA reads updated configuration from Redis in real-time.  
4. EA dynamically adjusts behavior without restarting.  

---

## 4. **Data Model**  

### 📊 **4.1. Trade Request Model**  
```json
{
  "order_id": "UUID",
  "symbol": "EURUSD",
  "volume": 1.0,
  "order_type": "BUY",
  "price": 1.12345,
  "stop_loss": 1.12000,
  "take_profit": 1.12500
}
```

### 📊 **4.2. Trade State Model**  
```json
{
  "trade_id": "UUID",
  "symbol": "EURUSD",
  "volume": 1.0,
  "status": "OPEN",
  "profit": 45.67,
  "entry_price": 1.12345,
  "stop_loss": 1.12000,
  "take_profit": 1.12500
}
```

### 📊 **4.3. Configuration Model**  
```json
{
  "lot_size": 0.1,
  "max_drawdown": 5.0,
  "max_open_orders": 10,
  "trailing_stop": true,
  "slippage": 1.5
}
```

## 5. **Trade Execution Path**  

1. EA receives order request from Redis RTSS.  
2. EA validates order parameters.  
3. EA sends trade request using `OrderSend()` in MT5.  
4. EA waits for trade result.  
5. If successful → logs state in Redis RTS and RTRS.  
6. If failed → logs error and retries based on backoff.  
7. EA monitors position and updates Redis RTS.  
8. EA closes position when target/stop is hit.  

---

## 6. **Trade State Sync Path**  
1. EA pushes account state to Redis RTS every 500ms.  
2. EA logs error if Redis connection fails.  
3. If connection fails for more than 3 retries → EA disables trade sync and triggers a network error.  

---

## 7. **Edge Cases**  
| **Edge Case** | **Handling** |
|--------------|--------------|
| Redis connection failure | Retry 3 times → If failed → disable sync |
| Trade rejected | Return MT5 error code to Redis RTRS |
| MT5 crash | Attempt auto-restart |
| Tick data overflow | Auto-purge old tick data |
| Configuration update failure | Log error → Retry on next cycle |
| Network failure | Notify backend → Attempt reconnection |

---

## 8. **Security Design**  
✅ Use secure Redis connection (protected mode).  
✅ Limit trade placement by IP/Session ID.  
✅ Enforce stop-loss and take-profit boundaries.  
✅ Validate order data against broker rules before placing orders.  
✅ Log security breaches into Redis.  

---

## 9. **Performance Tuning**  
✅ Process trade signals in memory using pre-allocated objects.  
✅ Parallel order handling using multi-threading (Rust).  
✅ Limit active tick data to 1,000 ticks per pair to reduce memory footprint.  
✅ Use direct memory access for tick data handling.  

---

## 10. **Backup and Recovery**  
✅ Trade state data stored in Redis (backup every 60 seconds).  
✅ Tick data stored only in memory → No backup.  
✅ Configuration stored in Redis → Backup to DuckDB.  
✅ Redis replication enabled for trade state and configuration.  

---

## 11. **High Availability**  
✅ If EA crashes → Auto-restart after 3 seconds.  
✅ If Redis connection fails → Auto-reconnect every 2 seconds.  
✅ If broker connection fails → Auto-reconnect every 5 seconds.  
✅ If auto-restart fails → Notify backend and attempt recovery.
