### ✅ **Tick Data Handling (Direct Memory + Redis) – Design Overview**

This section outlines the strategy for handling high-frequency tick data from the EA, ensuring minimal latency, predictable memory usage, and reliable backup for recovery.

---

## 🏆 **Design Objectives**
1. **Minimize latency** – Ensure that tick data reaches TradingView as close to real-time as possible.  
2. **Predictable memory usage** – Avoid memory overflows by using a fixed-size buffer.  
3. **Reliable recovery** – Ensure recovery from short-term connection failures without overloading Redis.  
4. **Efficient throughput** – Handle thousands of ticks per second without performance degradation.

## 🚀 **Flow Design**
### ✅ **1. Direct Memory Buffer (Primary Delivery Path)**
- EA writes tick data to a **direct memory ring buffer** (FIFO).  
- Buffer is fixed-size → Newest tick overwrites the oldest when full.  
- Buffer size = **5 seconds of ticks** (~500 KB).  

### ✅ **2. UDP + TCP Delivery to TradingView**  
- UDP sends tick data immediately to TradingView.  
- TCP follows to ensure consistency and fill any gaps.  
- TradingView replaces UDP ticks with TCP ticks when available.  

### ✅ **3. Redis Backup (Secondary Recovery Path)**  
- Every **100ms**, EA compresses the tick batch and stores it in a Redis stream.  
- Redis stores last **5 seconds** of compressed ticks as a rolling window.  
- If connection drops, TradingView syncs missing ticks from Redis.  

### ✅ **4. Overwrite Strategy**  
- Direct memory buffer overwrites itself after 5 seconds (FIFO).  
- Redis stream discards oldest ticks after 5 seconds.

## 🧠 **Memory Usage Strategy**
| Component | Expected Size | Buffer Type | Expiry |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| **Direct Memory Buffer** | ~500 KB (5 sec) | Ring Buffer | Overwrite oldest |
| **Redis Stream** | ~5 seconds of compressed ticks (~200 KB) | Stream | Overwrite oldest |
| **Prometheus Metrics** | ~50–100 KB/s | Streamed | Permanent |

## ✅ **Handling Recovery and Failures**
| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Direct Memory Overflow** | Overwrite oldest ticks (no data loss). |
| **TradingView Connection Loss** | Sync last 5 seconds from Redis. |
| **Redis Connection Loss** | Direct memory buffer will continue handling ticks. |
| **Network Congestion** | UDP backlog managed by direct memory (FIFO). |

## 🔥 **Advantages of Hybrid Strategy**  
✅ Near-zero latency via direct memory.  
✅ Reliable short-term recovery using Redis.  
✅ Predictable memory usage = no risk of overflow.  
✅ Fast resync after connection failure.
