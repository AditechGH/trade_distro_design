🔥 **Let’s tackle the High Availability (HA) Phase for DuckDB** — this is where we ensure that DuckDB remains **online and functional** even in the face of hardware failures, crashes, or resource contention.  

Since DuckDB is an embedded, single-file database, we need to get creative with how we implement HA — focusing on **process management**, **automatic recovery**, and **replication fallback**.  

---

# 🚀 **DuckDB High Availability Design**  
✅ **Goal:**  
- Minimize downtime in the event of a system or process failure.  
- Automatically recover from crashes and unexpected failures.  
- Ensure that data is not lost or corrupted during recovery.  
- Ensure continuous availability of trade state for real-time trading.  
- Provide a fallback mechanism for query execution.  

---

## ✅ **1. High Availability Challenges for DuckDB**  
Unlike traditional client-server databases:  
✅ DuckDB is embedded → No native clustering or failover support.  
✅ Single-file database → Vulnerable to file locks and corruption.  
✅ HA cannot be achieved with replicas → We need process-level resilience.  

---

## ✅ **2. HA Strategy Overview**
We will implement a **multi-layered HA strategy** combining:  

| Layer | HA Strategy | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Process-Level** | Process monitoring and auto-restart | Prevent downtime from crashes |
| **File-Level** | WAL + Incremental backup | Ensure state consistency |
| **Sync-Level** | Sync with ClickHouse | Ensure state recovery from cloud |
| **Concurrency-Level** | Multi-threading + Process partitioning | Maximize query execution throughput |
| **Load-Level** | Load balancing between processes | Prevent overloading |
| **State Retention** | WAL + Memory Caching | Ensure real-time state retention |

---

## ✅ **3. Process-Level HA**
### 🔹 **Problem:**  
- If the DuckDB process crashes → Trade state becomes unavailable.  
- High availability requires automatic process recovery.  

---

### 🔹 **Solution:**  
1. **Run DuckDB as a Managed Process**  
✅ Launch DuckDB as a separate process using **Rust**.  
✅ Monitor process health → Restart on failure.  

👉 Example (Rust):  
```rust
use std::process::Command;

fn start_duckdb() {
    let mut child = Command::new("duckdb")
        .arg("trade_data.duckdb")
        .spawn()
        .expect("Failed to start DuckDB process");

    let status = child.wait().expect("DuckDB process failed");
    if !status.success() {
        println!("DuckDB process failed — restarting...");
        start_duckdb();
    }
}
```

---

2. **Use Systemd (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows) for Auto-Restart**  
✅ Register DuckDB process as a systemd or Task Scheduler service.  
✅ Restart automatically on failure.  

👉 Example (Linux):  
```bash
sudo systemctl enable duckdb.service
sudo systemctl start duckdb.service
```

👉 Example (Windows):  
```powershell
New-ScheduledTask -Action (New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "duckdb.exe")
```

---

3. **Graceful Shutdown and Restart**  
✅ Use a signal handler to capture `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` and allow safe shutdown.  

👉 Example (Rust):  
```rust
use signal_hook::iterator::Signals;

fn main() {
    let signals = Signals::new(&[signal_hook::consts::SIGINT]).unwrap();

    for signal in signals.forever() {
        if signal == signal_hook::consts::SIGINT {
            println!("Shutting down DuckDB gracefully...");
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

---

4. **Process Health Monitoring with DaemonGuard**  
✅ Use **DaemonGuard** to monitor process health.  
✅ Restart DuckDB process if unresponsive for **10 seconds**.  

👉 Example:  
```rust
if !is_process_responsive("duckdb") {
    restart_process("duckdb");
}
```

---

### ✅ **Process-Level HA Settings:**  
| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Auto-Restart** | ✅ | Restart on failure |
| **Health Check Interval** | `5s` | Monitor process health |
| **Max Restart Attempts** | `3` | Prevent restart loop |
| **Signal Handling** | ✅ | Graceful shutdown |
| **DaemonGuard** | ✅ | Monitor and auto-recover |

---

## ✅ **4. File-Level HA**
### 🔹 **Problem:**  
- If DuckDB file becomes corrupted → Total data loss.  

---

### 🔹 **Solution:**  
1. **Enable Write-Ahead Log (WAL):**  
✅ WAL ensures that state is recoverable even after a hard crash.  
✅ WAL syncs state every **10 seconds**.  

👉 Example:  
```sql
PRAGMA enable_wal;
```

---

2. **Set Automatic Checkpoints:**  
✅ Flush WAL to disk every **5,000 transactions**.  

👉 Example:  
```sql
PRAGMA wal_autocheckpoint = 5000;
```

---

3. **Automatic File Integrity Checks:**  
✅ DuckDB has built-in corruption detection → We will trigger integrity checks every minute.  

👉 Example:  
```sql
PRAGMA integrity_check;
```

---

### ✅ **File-Level HA Settings:**  
| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **WAL Enabled** | ✅ | Real-time recovery |
| **Checkpoint Interval** | 5,000 transactions | Reduce memory footprint |
| **Integrity Check** | Every 1 minute | Detect corruption |
| **Max WAL Retention** | 1 hour | Retain up to 1 hour of state |

---

## ✅ **5. Sync-Level HA**
### 🔹 **Problem:**  
- If DuckDB state becomes inconsistent → Sync failure to ClickHouse.  

---

### 🔹 **Solution:**  
1. **Use Incremental Sync to ClickHouse:**  
✅ Sync state every **5 minutes** using Python-based sync.  
✅ Track sync state in Redis.  

👉 Example:  
```python
def sync_to_clickhouse():
    conn.execute("INSERT INTO clickhouse ...")
```

---

2. **Auto-Retry on Sync Failure:**  
✅ Retry failed syncs with exponential backoff.  

👉 Example:  
```python
backoff = [5, 15, 30, 60]
for retry in backoff:
    try:
        sync_to_clickhouse()
        break
    except:
        time.sleep(retry)
```

---

### ✅ **Sync-Level HA Settings:**  
| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Sync Interval** | 5 minutes | Minimize latency |
| **Auto-Retry** | ✅ | Ensure sync completion |
| **Backoff** | 5–60 sec | Prevent overload |
| **Max Sync Failures** | 5 | Stop after 5 failures |

---

## ✅ **6. Load-Level HA**
### 🔹 **Problem:**  
- Overload during high-frequency trade execution.  

---

### 🔹 **Solution:**  
1. **Limit Concurrent Query Execution:**  
✅ Limit active threads to avoid overload.  

👉 Example:  
```sql
SET threads = 4;
```

---

2. **Use Query Queuing:**  
✅ Queued queries → Prevent overload.  

👉 Example:  
```sql
PRAGMA queue_size = 10;
```

---

### ✅ **Load-Level HA Settings:**  
| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Threads** | 4 | CPU-bound processing |
| **Queue Size** | 10 | Query queuing |
| **Connection Pool** | 10 | Limit connection overhead |

---

## ✅ **7. State Retention HA**
### 🔹 **Problem:**  
- State could be lost if process crashes before WAL sync.  

---

### 🔹 **Solution:**  
1. **Retain WAL + Incremental Backups:**  
✅ Keep last 1 hour of state.  

2. **Memory-Resident State:**  
✅ Keep most recent state in Redis → Allow fast reload.  

👉 Example:  
```python
redis.set("last_trade_state", state)
```

---

### ✅ **State Retention HA Settings:**  
| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **WAL Retention** | 1 hour | Fast recovery |
| **Redis State Retention** | 1 hour | Real-time recovery |
| **Max WAL Size** | 256 MB | Memory safety |

---

## 🏆 **Final HA Strategy:**  
| HA Type | Status | Goal |
|---------|--------|------|
| **Process-Level** | ✅ | Restart + Graceful Shutdown |
| **File-Level** | ✅ | Prevent Corruption |
| **Sync-Level** | ✅ | State Consistency |
| **Load-Level** | ✅ | Prevent Overload |
| **State Retention** | ✅ | Real-Time Recovery |

---

## 🔥 **Next Step Proposal:**  
1. ✅ Test failover scenarios.  
2. ✅ Test sync failures and auto-recovery.  
3. ✅ Finalize HA process guardrails.  
4. ✅ Proceed to **Fault Tolerance Phase**.
