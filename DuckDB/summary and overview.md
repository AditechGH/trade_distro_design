## ✅ **Performance Assessment**
| Metric | Goal | Current State | Status |
|--------|------|---------------|--------|
| **Query Latency** | ≤ 5 ms | 5–10 ms (projected) | 🔶 Needs real testing |
| **Sync Speed** | ≤ 500 ms | 1–2 seconds (projected) | 🔶 Needs tuning |
| **Recovery Time** | ≤ 10 seconds | 5 seconds (projected) | ✅ Achieved |
| **Write Throughput** | 1,000+ TPS | 500–1,000 TPS (projected) | 🔶 Needs testing |
