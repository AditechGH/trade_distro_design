🔥 **Let’s dive into the DuckDB Permissions and Security Design** — this is where we define how **data access, encryption, and user roles** will be managed at the DuckDB level. Given that DuckDB handles sensitive state (like credentials and trade history), we need to lock down security carefully.

---

# 🚀 **DuckDB Permissions and Security Design**
✅ **Goal:**  
- Ensure secure access to DuckDB data.  
- Minimize attack surface through strict access controls.  
- Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., credentials) at rest and during transit.  
- Enforce fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC).  
- Ensure compliance with security standards for financial data.  

---

## ✅ **1. Why Permissions and Security Matter in DuckDB**
DuckDB is primarily a local, embedded database, so:  
✅ **Direct network exposure is low** → Low attack surface.  
✅ **Attack surface = File-level access** → We must protect file integrity.  
✅ **Sensitive data** = Credentials, trade history → Must be encrypted.  
✅ **Execution environment** = Local-first → No need for complex multi-user setup.  

---

## 🔥 **Key Threat Vectors:**  
| Threat | Risk Level | Mitigation Strategy |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| **Direct File Access** | High | OS-level encryption + permission lockdown |
| **Credential Leakage** | High | AES-256 encryption + secure keychain storage |
| **Session Hijacking** | Medium | Encrypted sessions + MFA validation |
| **Data Corruption** | Medium | Transaction rollback + data integrity checks |
| **Unauthorized Queries** | High | Fine-grained access control using user roles |

---

## ✅ **2. Access Model Overview**  
| Layer | Purpose | Control Mechanism |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **File-Level** | Control access to DuckDB file | OS-level permissions |
| **Database-Level** | Grant access to tables and queries | Role-based permissions |
| **Data-Level** | Control access to individual records | Row-level encryption |
| **Encryption-Level** | Encrypt sensitive data | AES-256 + OS keychain |

---

## ✅ **3. File-Level Access Control**
DuckDB is a file-based database — access is controlled at the **file level** using OS permissions:

### 🔹 **File Location:**  
`C:/TradeSystem/Data/trade_data.duckdb`

### 🔹 **OS-Level Permissions:**  
✅ Only the user running the MT5 instance and the DuckDB process will have read/write access.  
✅ On Linux/Windows → Use restrictive permissions:

👉 **Linux Example:**  
```bash
chmod 600 trade_data.duckdb  # Owner read/write only
```

👉 **Windows Example:**  
```powershell
icacls "C:\TradeSystem\Data\trade_data.duckdb" /grant %USERNAME%:F
```

### 🔹 **Disable External Access:**  
✅ Ensure DuckDB file is **not exposed** to the network.  
✅ No listening ports → Direct file access only.  

---

## ✅ **4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
We need to implement fine-grained permissions at the **DuckDB query level** using roles:

### 🔹 **Roles:**  
| Role | Access Level | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Admin** | Full access | All database objects and queries |
| **Trader** | Read/write to trade state | Limited to state and trade-level queries |
| **Analyst** | Read-only | Access to historical trade data only |
| **User** | Read-only | Access to personal session and preference state |

---

### 🔹 **Example DuckDB Role Creation:**  
```sql
CREATE ROLE admin;
CREATE ROLE trader;
CREATE ROLE analyst;
CREATE ROLE user;
```

### 🔹 **Example Role Assignment:**  
```sql
GRANT admin TO 'john_doe';
GRANT trader TO 'trader_1';
GRANT analyst TO 'analyst_1';
GRANT user TO 'user_1';
```

---

### 🔹 **Fine-Grained Permissions:**  
| Permission | Role | Example Command |
|------------|------|-----------------|
| **CREATE, DROP** | `admin` | `GRANT CREATE ON DATABASE TO admin;` |
| **INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE** | `trader`, `admin` | `GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON trades TO trader;` |
| **SELECT** | `analyst`, `trader`, `user` | `GRANT SELECT ON trades TO analyst;` |
| **MODIFY CONFIG** | `admin` | `GRANT MODIFY ON CONFIG TO admin;` |

---

### 🔹 **Example Grant Statement:**  
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON trades TO trader;
```

---

## ✅ **5. Row-Level Security (RLS)**
We need to restrict row access based on user identity and scope:

### 🔹 **Trade-Level RLS:**  
✅ Traders can only view/edit their own trades  
✅ Analysts can view but NOT modify trades  

👉 Example:  
```sql
CREATE POLICY trade_access 
ON trades 
FOR SELECT 
USING (user_id = current_user)
WITH CHECK (user_id = current_user);
```

---

### 🔹 **Broker-Level RLS:**  
✅ Traders can only modify trades for their assigned broker  
✅ Analysts can only view trades for their assigned broker  

👉 Example:  
```sql
CREATE POLICY broker_access 
ON trades 
FOR SELECT 
USING (broker_id = current_broker);
```

---

## ✅ **6. Encryption Strategy**
We need to encrypt sensitive fields at rest:

### 🔹 **Fields to Encrypt:**  
| Table | Fields |
|-------|--------|
| **credentials** | login_number, password |
| **trades** | order size, PnL |
| **account** | leverage, balance, equity |

### 🔹 **Encryption Method:**  
✅ **AES-256** for encryption  
✅ Encryption keys stored in **OS keychain**  
✅ **Automatic key rotation** every 90 days  

👉 Example:  
```python
import duckdb
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher = Fernet(key)

conn = duckdb.connect('trade_data.duckdb')
encrypted_password = cipher.encrypt(b"password123")

conn.execute(f"""
INSERT INTO credentials (login_number, password)
VALUES ('123456', '{encrypted_password.decode('utf-8')}')
""")
```

---

### 🔹 **Key Rotation Example:**  
✅ Rotate every 90 days → Re-encrypt data with new key  
✅ Old key → Retain for up to 30 days for backward compatibility  

👉 Example:  
```python
new_key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher = Fernet(new_key)

# Decrypt old data
decrypted = old_cipher.decrypt(encrypted_data)

# Re-encrypt with new key
new_encrypted = cipher.encrypt(decrypted)
```

---

## ✅ **7. Secure Connection Handling**
✅ DuckDB supports direct file access — no open ports  
✅ No external network exposure  
✅ Secure transmission of backup to PostgreSQL using HTTPS + TLS 1.2/1.3  

---

## ✅ **8. Audit and Logging**
✅ Keep audit trail for:  
- All `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` actions  
- Successful/failed queries  
- Role modifications  
✅ Store logs in **ClickHouse** for long-term analysis  

👉 Example:  
```sql
INSERT INTO audit_log 
(event_type, user_id, table_name, timestamp)
VALUES ('INSERT', 'user_1', 'trades', now());
```

---

## ✅ **9. Data Retention and Purging**
✅ Trade state → Retain until trade closes  
✅ Credentials → Retain until account removed  
✅ Performance Data → Retain for 5 years (regulatory compliance)  
✅ Execution Logs → Purge after 30 days  

---

## ✅ **10. Example Permissions Strategy:**  
| Role | Permission Type | Scope |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| **Admin** | Full access | All objects |
| **Trader** | Select, insert, update, delete | Trade-related tables |
| **Analyst** | Select | Historical data only |
| **User** | Select | Own session state and preferences |
